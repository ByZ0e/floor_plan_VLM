Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the room and door connections, then provide a navigation plan from DEGT to CELLIER.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects Porche and Sejour
D2: Connects Cellier and Cuisine
D3: Connects Sejour and Cuisine
D4: Connects Sejour and DEGT
D5: Connects DEGT and CH.1
D6: Connects DEGT and CH.2
D7: Connects DEGT and Bains
D8: Connects DEGT and WC

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in DEGT
2. Approach and open D4
3. Go through D4 to enter Sejour
4. Approach and open D1
5. Go through D1 to enter Porche
6. Approach and open D2
7. Go through D2 to reach Cellier

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from DEGT to CELLIER using only the necessary doors and rooms.
