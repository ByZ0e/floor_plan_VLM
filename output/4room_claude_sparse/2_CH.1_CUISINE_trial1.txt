Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from CH.1 to CUISINE.

Rooms and Doors:
1. CH.1 - connected to SEJOUR via D5
2. SEJOUR - connected to CH.1 via D5, to DEGT via D4, to Porche via D1
3. Porche - connected to SEJOUR via D1, to CELLIER via D2
4. CELLIER - connected to Porche via D2
5. CUISINE - connected to DEGT via D3
6. DEGT - connected to SEJOUR via D4, to CUISINE via D3, to CH.2 via D6, to BAINS via D7
7. CH.2 - connected to DEGT via D6
8. BAINS - connected to DEGT via D7
9. WC - connected to DEGT via D8

Navigation Plan:
1. ApproachDoor(5)
2. OpenDoor(5)
3. GoThrough(5)
4. ApproachDoor(4)
5. OpenDoor(4)
6. GoThrough(4)
7. ApproachDoor(3)
8. OpenDoor(3)
9. GoThrough(3)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from CH.1 to CUISINE using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
