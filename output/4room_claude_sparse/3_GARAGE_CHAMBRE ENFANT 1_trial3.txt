Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the GARAGE to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER
2. D2: Connects CELLIER to PORCHE
3. D3: Connects PORCHE to LINGERIE
4. D4: Connects LINGERIE to WC
5. D5: Connects LINGERIE to BUREAU
6. D6: Connects BUREAU to BAINS
7. D7: Connects BAINS to CHAMBRE PARENTS
8. D8: Connects CHAMBRE PARENTS to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
9. D9: Connects CHAMBRE ENFANT 2 to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
10. D10: Connects CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 to HALL
11. D11: Connects CELLIER to HALL

Navigation Plan:
To go from the GARAGE to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1, we'll use the following path: GARAGE -> CELLIER -> HALL -> CHAMBRE ENFANT 1.

Here's the step-by-step navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 11},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 10}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the GARAGE to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
