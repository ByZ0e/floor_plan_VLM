Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the WC to the PORCHE.

Rooms and Doors with Connections:

1. WC: Connected to DEGT via D8
2. BAINS: Connected to DEGT via D7
3. DEGT: Connected to WC (D8), BAINS (D7), CUISINE (D3), SEJOUR (D4), and CH.1 (D6)
4. CUISINE: Connected to DEGT via D3
5. SEJOUR: Connected to DEGT via D4 and PORCHE via D1
6. CH.1: Connected to DEGT via D6
7. CH.2: No direct door connection visible
8. PORCHE: Connected to SEJOUR via D1
9. CELLIER: Connected to PORCHE via D2

Navigation Plan:

To get from the WC to the PORCHE, we need to go through the following sequence:
WC -> DEGT -> SEJOUR -> PORCHE

Here's the detailed action plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D8"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D8"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D8"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D1"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the WC to the PORCHE using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
