Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from PORCHE1 to CELLIER 1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. PORCHE1 connects to GARAGE1 via D21
2. PORCHE1 connects to CELLIER1 via D31
3. CELLIER1 connects to GARAGE1 via D13
4. CELLIER1 connects to HALL1 via D111

Step-by-step solution:
1. Starting in PORCHE1
2. Use D31 to go from PORCHE1 to CELLIER1

Final Navigation Plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D31"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D31"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D31"}
  ]
}
```

This is the most efficient path from PORCHE1 to CELLIER1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
