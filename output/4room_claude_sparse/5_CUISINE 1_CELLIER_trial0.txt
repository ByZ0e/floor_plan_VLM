Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from CUISINE 1 to CELLIER.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D31 connects CUISINE1 and SEJOUR1
2. D21 connects CELLIER1 and Porche1
3. D11 connects Porche1 and SEJOUR1
4. D10 connects CELLIER and Porche
5. D2 connects Porche and CUISINE
6. D3 connects CUISINE and SEJOUR

Now, let's create the navigation plan from CUISINE 1 to CELLIER:

1. ApproachDoor(D31)
2. OpenDoor(D31)
3. GoThrough(D31)
4. ApproachDoor(D11)
5. OpenDoor(D11)
6. GoThrough(D11)
7. ApproachDoor(D10)
8. OpenDoor(D10)
9. GoThrough(D10)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CUISINE 1",
  "end": "CELLIER",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D31"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D31"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D31"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D10"}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan will efficiently guide you from CUISINE 1 to CELLIER using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
