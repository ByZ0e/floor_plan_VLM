Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the GARAGE to the WC.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER
2. D2: Connects CELLIER to PORCHE
3. D3: Connects PORCHE to LINGERIE
4. D4: Connects LINGERIE to WC
5. D5: Connects LINGERIE to BUREAU
6. D6: Connects BUREAU to BAINS
7. D7: Connects BAINS to CHAMBRE PARENTS
8. D8: Connects CHAMBRE PARENTS to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
9. D9: Connects CHAMBRE PARENTS to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
10. D10: Connects CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
11. D11: Connects CELLIER to HALL

Navigation Plan:
To go from the GARAGE to the WC, we need to follow this path: GARAGE -> CELLIER -> PORCHE -> LINGERIE -> WC

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in GARAGE
2. ApproachDoor(D1)
3. OpenDoor(D1)
4. GoThrough(D1) to enter CELLIER
5. ApproachDoor(D2)
6. OpenDoor(D2)
7. GoThrough(D2) to enter PORCHE
8. ApproachDoor(D3)
9. OpenDoor(D3)
10. GoThrough(D3) to enter LINGERIE
11. ApproachDoor(D4)
12. OpenDoor(D4)
13. GoThrough(D4) to enter WC

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from the GARAGE to the WC, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
