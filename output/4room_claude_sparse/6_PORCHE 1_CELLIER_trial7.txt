Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from PORCHE1 to CELLIER 1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. PORCHE1 <-> D21 <-> GARAGE 1
2. PORCHE1 <-> D31 <-> CELLIER 1
3. CELLIER 1 <-> D13 <-> GARAGE 1
4. CELLIER 1 <-> D111 <-> HALL 1

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in PORCHE1
2. Use D31 to go directly to CELLIER 1

Final Navigation Plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "PORCHE1",
  "goal": "CELLIER 1",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D31"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D31"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D31"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from PORCHE1 to CELLIER 1 using only the necessary doors. The robot will approach door D31, open it, and go through to reach the CELLIER 1, completing the navigation task.
