Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the CELLIER to the TERRASSE COUVERTE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CELLIER connects to GARAGE via D9
2. CELLIER connects to HALL via D1
3. HALL connects to CHAMBRE 2 via D5
4. HALL connects to WC via D2
5. HALL connects to CHAMBRE 1 via D4
6. HALL connects to PORCHE via D6
7. PORCHE connects to CUISINE via D7
8. CUISINE connects to TERRASSE COUVERTE via D8
9. BAINS connects to WC via D3
10. There's a D10 connecting the exterior to the interior, but it's not needed for this route

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in CELLIER
2. Use D1 to enter HALL
3. Use D6 to enter PORCHE
4. Use D7 to enter CUISINE
5. Use D8 to reach TERRASSE COUVERTE

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan provides the most efficient route from the CELLIER to the TERRASSE COUVERTE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
