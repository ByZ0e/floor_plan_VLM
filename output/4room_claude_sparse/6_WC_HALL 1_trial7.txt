Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll start by listing the relevant rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Relevant Room and Door Connections:
- WC is connected to LINGERIE via D4
- LINGERIE is connected to BUREAU via D5
- BUREAU is connected to BAINS via D6
- BAINS is connected to HALL via D7
- HALL is connected to HALL 1 via D12

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
1. Start in WC
2. ApproachDoor(D4)
3. OpenDoor(D4)
4. GoThrough(D4) to enter LINGERIE
5. ApproachDoor(D5)
6. OpenDoor(D5)
7. GoThrough(D5) to enter BUREAU
8. ApproachDoor(D6)
9. OpenDoor(D6)
10. GoThrough(D6) to enter BAINS
11. ApproachDoor(D7)
12. OpenDoor(D7)
13. GoThrough(D7) to enter HALL
14. ApproachDoor(D12)
15. OpenDoor(D12)
16. GoThrough(D12) to enter HALL 1

Now, I'll provide the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(D4)",
    "OpenDoor(D4)",
    "GoThrough(D4)",
    "ApproachDoor(D5)",
    "OpenDoor(D5)",
    "GoThrough(D5)",
    "ApproachDoor(D6)",
    "OpenDoor(D6)",
    "GoThrough(D6)",
    "ApproachDoor(D7)",
    "OpenDoor(D7)",
    "GoThrough(D7)",
    "ApproachDoor(D12)",
    "OpenDoor(D12)",
    "GoThrough(D12)"
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan will efficiently guide you from the WC to HALL 1 using only the necessary doors and rooms.
