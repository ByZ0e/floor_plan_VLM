Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the WC to the PORCHE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. WC: Connected to DEGT via D8
2. DEGT: Connected to WC via D8, SEJOUR via D4, CH.1 via D6
3. SEJOUR: Connected to DEGT via D4, CUISINE via D3, PORCHE via D1
4. CUISINE: Connected to SEJOUR via D3
5. PORCHE: Connected to SEJOUR via D1
6. CH.1: Connected to DEGT via D6
7. CH.2: Not directly connected to any room through visible doors
8. BAINS: Connected to DEGT via D7
9. CELLIER: Connected to PORCHE via D2 (but not needed for this route)

Navigation Plan:
Starting from the WC, we need to go through DEGT and SEJOUR to reach PORCHE. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(8)
2. OpenDoor(8)
3. GoThrough(8)
4. ApproachDoor(4)
5. OpenDoor(4)
6. GoThrough(4)
7. ApproachDoor(1)
8. OpenDoor(1)
9. GoThrough(1)

This plan efficiently navigates from the WC to the PORCHE using only the necessary doors.

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan takes you from the WC to the PORCHE in the most efficient manner, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
