Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan from CUISINE 1 to CELLIER.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

1. CUISINE 1 connects to SEJOUR 1 via door D31
2. SEJOUR 1 connects to CELLIER 1 via door D21
3. CELLIER 1 connects to CELLIER via door D10
4. CUISINE connects to SEJOUR via door D3
5. SEJOUR connects to CELLIER via door D2
6. SEJOUR connects to CH.1 via door D5
7. CH.1 connects to DEGT via door D6
8. DEGT connects to BAINS via door D7
9. DEGT connects to CH.2 via door D9
10. SEJOUR 1 connects to CH.3 via door D51
11. CH.3 connects to DEGT 1 via door D61
12. DEGT 1 connects to BAINS 1 via door D71
13. DEGT 1 connects to CH.4 via door D9 (shared with the other side)

Navigation Plan:
To go from CUISINE 1 to CELLIER, we need to use the following sequence of actions:

1. ApproachDoor(D31)
2. OpenDoor(D31)
3. GoThrough(D31)
4. ApproachDoor(D21)
5. OpenDoor(D21)
6. GoThrough(D21)
7. ApproachDoor(D10)
8. OpenDoor(D10)
9. GoThrough(D10)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D31"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D31"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D31"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D21"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D21"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D21"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D10"}
  ]
}
```

This path takes you from CUISINE 1 through SEJOUR 1 and CELLIER 1 to finally reach CELLIER, using only the necessary doors along the way.
