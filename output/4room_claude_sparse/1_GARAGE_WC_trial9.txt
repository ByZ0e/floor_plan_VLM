Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the connections and provide a navigation plan as requested.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects Cellier to Hall
D2: Connects WC to Hall
D3: Connects Hall to Chambre 1
D4: Connects Hall to Chambre 1 (alternative entrance)
D5: Connects Hall to Chambre 2
D6: Connects Hall to Porche
D7: Connects Cuisine to Hall
D8: Connects Cuisine to Terrasse Couverte
D9: Connects Garage to Cellier

Now, let's create the navigation plan from the Garage to the WC:

1. ApproachDoor(9)
2. OpenDoor(9)
3. GoThrough(9)
4. ApproachDoor(1)
5. OpenDoor(1)
6. GoThrough(1)
7. ApproachDoor(2)
8. OpenDoor(2)
9. GoThrough(2)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 9},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2}
  ]
}
```

This path takes you from the Garage through the Cellier and Hall to reach the WC, using only the necessary doors for the most efficient route.
