Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll start by listing the relevant rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Relevant Room and Door Connections:
- PORCHE1 connects to GARAGE1 via D21
- PORCHE1 connects to CELLIER1 via D31
- CELLIER1 connects to GARAGE1 via D13
- CELLIER1 connects to HALL1 via D111

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
1. Start in PORCHE1
2. ApproachDoor(D31)
3. OpenDoor(D31)
4. GoThrough(D31)

This sequence will take you from PORCHE1 to CELLIER1, which is the destination.

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "PORCHE1",
  "destination": "CELLIER1",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D31"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D31"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D31"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from PORCHE1 to CELLIER1 using only the necessary doors.
