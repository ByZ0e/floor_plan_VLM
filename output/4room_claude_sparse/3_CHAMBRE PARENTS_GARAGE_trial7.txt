Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms and doors, create a list of connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the CHAMBRE PARENTS to the GARAGE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D8: Connects CHAMBRE PARENTS to HALL
2. D7: Connects BAINS to HALL
3. D6: Connects BUREAU to HALL
4. D5: Connects LINGERIE to HALL
5. D4: Connects WC to PORCHE
6. D3: Connects PORCHE to HALL
7. D2: Connects PORCHE to CELLIER
8. D1: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE
9. D9: Connects CHAMBRE ENFANT 2 to HALL
10. D10: Connects CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 to HALL
11. D11: Connects CELLIER to HALL

Navigation Plan:
1. ApproachDoor(D8)
2. OpenDoor(D8)
3. GoThrough(D8)
4. ApproachDoor(D11)
5. OpenDoor(D11)
6. GoThrough(D11)
7. ApproachDoor(D1)
8. OpenDoor(D1)
9. GoThrough(D1)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from CHAMBRE PARENTS to GARAGE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
