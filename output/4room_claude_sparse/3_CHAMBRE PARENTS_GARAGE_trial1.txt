Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the CHAMBRE PARENTS to the GARAGE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CHAMBRE PARENTS: Connected to HALL via D8
2. BAINS: Connected to HALL via D7
3. BUREAU: Connected to HALL via D6
4. LINGERIE: Connected to HALL via D5
5. WC: Connected to PORCHE via D4
6. PORCHE: Connected to CELLIER via D3, to WC via D4
7. CELLIER: Connected to PORCHE via D3, to GARAGE via D1, to HALL via D11
8. GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER via D1
9. CHAMBRE ENFANT 1: Connected to HALL via D10
10. CHAMBRE ENFANT 2: Connected to HALL via D9
11. HALL: Connected to CHAMBRE PARENTS via D8, BAINS via D7, BUREAU via D6, LINGERIE via D5, CELLIER via D11, CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 via D10, CHAMBRE ENFANT 2 via D9

Navigation Plan:
1. ApproachDoor(8)
2. OpenDoor(8)
3. GoThrough(8)
4. ApproachDoor(11)
5. OpenDoor(11)
6. GoThrough(11)
7. ApproachDoor(1)
8. OpenDoor(1)
9. GoThrough(1)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 11},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the CHAMBRE PARENTS to the GARAGE using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
