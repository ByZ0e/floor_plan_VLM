Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the PORCHE to the BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
1. PORCHE connects to SEJOUR through D1
2. CELLIER connects to CUISINE through D2
3. SEJOUR connects to CUISINE through D3
4. SEJOUR connects to DEGT through D4
5. CH.1 connects to DEGT through D5
6. CH.2 connects to DEGT through D6
7. DEGT connects to BAINS through D7
8. DEGT connects to WC through D8

Now, let's create the navigation plan:

1. Start in PORCHE
2. ApproachDoor(D1)
3. OpenDoor(D1)
4. GoThrough(D1) // Now in SEJOUR
5. ApproachDoor(D4)
6. OpenDoor(D4)
7. GoThrough(D4) // Now in DEGT
8. ApproachDoor(D7)
9. OpenDoor(D7)
10. GoThrough(D7) // Now in BAINS

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"}
  ]
}
```

This path efficiently navigates from the PORCHE to the BAINS using only the necessary doors and rooms along the way.
