Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the WC to the PORCHE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. WC: Connected to DEGT through D8
2. DEGT: Connected to WC through D8, SEJOUR through D4, CH.1 through D6
3. SEJOUR: Connected to DEGT through D4, CUISINE through D3, PORCHE through D1
4. CUISINE: Connected to SEJOUR through D3, CELLIER through D2
5. CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE through D2
6. PORCHE: Connected to SEJOUR through D1
7. CH.1: Connected to DEGT through D6
8. CH.2: Connected to DEGT through D7
9. BAINS: Connected to DEGT through D5

Navigation Plan:
1. ApproachDoor(8)
2. OpenDoor(8)
3. GoThrough(8)
4. ApproachDoor(4)
5. OpenDoor(4)
6. GoThrough(4)
7. ApproachDoor(1)
8. OpenDoor(1)
9. GoThrough(1)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan will efficiently guide you from the WC to the PORCHE using only the necessary doors and rooms.
