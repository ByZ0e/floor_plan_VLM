Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a detailed navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
- CHAMBRE ENFANT 11 connects to HALL 1 via D101
- HALL 1 connects to CHAMBRE ENFANT 21 via D91
- HALL 1 connects to BAINS1 via D71
- HALL 1 connects to BUREAU1 via D61
- HALL 1 connects to LINGERIE1 via D51
- HALL 1 connects to WC1 via D41
- HALL 1 connects to PORCHE1 via D31
- HALL 1 connects to CELLIER 1 via D111
- CELLIER 1 connects to GARAGE 1 via D13

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CHAMBRE ENFANT 11
2. Use D101 to enter HALL 1

Final Navigation Plan in JSON format:
```json
{
  "start": "CHAMBRE ENFANT 11",
  "end": "HALL",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D101"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D101"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D101"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from CHAMBRE ENFANT 11 to HALL 1, using only the necessary door (D101) to complete the navigation task.
