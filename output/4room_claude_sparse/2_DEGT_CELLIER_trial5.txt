Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from DEGT to CELLIER.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects Porche and Sejour
D2: Connects Cellier and Sejour
D3: Connects Sejour and Cuisine
D4: Connects Sejour and DEGT
D5: Connects DEGT and CH.1
D6: Connects DEGT and CH.2
D7: Connects DEGT and Bains
D8: Connects DEGT and WC

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in DEGT
2. Use D4 to enter Sejour
3. Use D2 to enter Cellier

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D2"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D2"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D2"
    }
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan provides the most efficient path from DEGT to CELLIER, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or actions.
