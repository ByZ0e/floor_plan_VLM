Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from PORCHE1 to CELLIER 1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. PORCHE1 - D21 - GARAGE1
2. PORCHE1 - D31 - CELLIER1
3. CELLIER1 - D13 - GARAGE1
4. CELLIER1 - D111 - HALL1

Step-by-step solution:
To go from PORCHE1 to CELLIER1, we only need to use one door: D31.

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D31"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D31"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D31"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from PORCHE1 to CELLIER1 using the most direct path available.
