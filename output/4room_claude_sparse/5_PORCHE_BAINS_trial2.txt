Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from PORCHE to BAINS.

Rooms and Door Connections:
1. PORCHE - connected to SEJOUR via D1
2. SEJOUR - connected to PORCHE via D1, CUISINE via D2 and D3, CH.1 via D4, DEGT via D5
3. CUISINE - connected to SEJOUR via D2 and D3, CELLIER via D10
4. CELLIER - connected to CUISINE via D10
5. CH.1 - connected to SEJOUR via D4
6. DEGT - connected to SEJOUR via D5, CH.2 via D6, BAINS via D7, WC via D8
7. CH.2 - connected to DEGT via D6
8. BAINS - connected to DEGT via D7
9. WC - connected to DEGT via D8

Navigation Plan:
To go from PORCHE to BAINS, we need to follow this sequence:

1. ApproachDoor(D1)
2. OpenDoor(D1)
3. GoThrough(D1)
4. ApproachDoor(D5)
5. OpenDoor(D5)
6. GoThrough(D5)
7. ApproachDoor(D7)
8. OpenDoor(D7)
9. GoThrough(D7)

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from PORCHE to BAINS using the minimum number of necessary doors and actions.
