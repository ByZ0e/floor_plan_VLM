Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the GARAGE to the BUREAU.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER
2. D2: Connects CELLIER to PORCHE
3. D3: Connects PORCHE to HALL
4. D4: Connects HALL to WC
5. D5: Connects HALL to LINGERIE
6. D6: Connects HALL to BUREAU
7. D7: Connects HALL to BAINS
8. D8: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE PARENTS
9. D9: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
10. D10: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
11. D11: Connects CELLIER to HALL

Navigation Plan:
To go from the GARAGE to the BUREAU, we need to follow these steps:

1. ApproachDoor(1)
2. OpenDoor(1)
3. GoThrough(1)
4. ApproachDoor(11)
5. OpenDoor(11)
6. GoThrough(11)
7. ApproachDoor(6)
8. OpenDoor(6)
9. GoThrough(6)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 11},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6}
  ]
}
```

This path takes you from the GARAGE through the CELLIER and HALL to reach the BUREAU efficiently, using only the necessary doors along the way.
