Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan from PORCHE to BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
1. PORCHE: connected to SEJOUR via D1
2. SEJOUR: connected to PORCHE via D1, CUISINE via D3, DEGT via D5
3. CUISINE: connected to SEJOUR via D3, CELLIER via D2
4. CELLIER: connected to CUISINE via D2
5. DEGT: connected to SEJOUR via D5, CH.1 via D6, BAINS via D7, CH.2 via D9
6. CH.1: connected to DEGT via D6
7. BAINS: connected to DEGT via D7
8. CH.2: connected to DEGT via D9

Navigation Plan:
To go from PORCHE to BAINS, we need to follow these steps:

1. ApproachDoor(D1)
2. OpenDoor(D1)
3. GoThrough(D1)
4. ApproachDoor(D5)
5. OpenDoor(D5)
6. GoThrough(D5)
7. ApproachDoor(D7)
8. OpenDoor(D7)
9. GoThrough(D7)

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "PORCHE",
  "end": "BAINS",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient path from PORCHE to BAINS, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
