Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from CH.1 to CUISINE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects Porche and Sejour
2. D2: Connects Cellier and Sejour
3. D3: Connects Sejour and Cuisine
4. D4: Connects Sejour and Degt
5. D5: Connects CH.1 and Degt
6. D6: Connects Degt and CH.2
7. D7: Connects Degt and Bains
8. D8: Connects Degt and WC

Navigation Plan from CH.1 to CUISINE:

1. Start in CH.1
2. ApproachDoor(D5)
3. OpenDoor(D5)
4. GoThrough(D5) - Now in Degt
5. ApproachDoor(D4)
6. OpenDoor(D4)
7. GoThrough(D4) - Now in Sejour
8. ApproachDoor(D3)
9. OpenDoor(D3)
10. GoThrough(D3) - Now in Cuisine

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CH.1",
  "end": "CUISINE",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan provides the most efficient route from CH.1 to CUISINE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
