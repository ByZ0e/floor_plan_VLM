Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from CHAMBRE ENFANT 11 to HALL 1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D91 connects CHAMBRE ENFANT 11 to HALL 1
2. D101 connects CHAMBRE ENFANT 21 to HALL 1
3. D81 connects CHAMBRE PARENTS1 to HALL 1
4. D71 connects BAINS1 to HALL 1
5. D61 connects BUREAU1 to HALL 1
6. D51 connects LINGERIE1 to HALL 1
7. D41 connects WC1 to HALL 1
8. D31 connects PORCHE1 to CELLIER 1
9. D21 connects PORCHE1 to GARAGE 1
10. D13 connects GARAGE 1 to CELLIER 1
11. D111 connects CELLIER 1 to HALL 1

Navigation Plan:
To get from CHAMBRE ENFANT 11 to HALL 1, we only need to use one door:

1. ApproachDoor(91)
2. OpenDoor(91)
3. GoThrough(91)

This sequence will take you directly from CHAMBRE ENFANT 11 to HALL 1.

Here's the plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CHAMBRE ENFANT 11",
  "end": "HALL 1",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 91},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 91},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 91}
  ]
}
```

This is the most efficient path from CHAMBRE ENFANT 11 to HALL 1, using only the necessary door to complete the navigation task.
