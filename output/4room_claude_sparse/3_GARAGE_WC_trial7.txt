Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the connections and provide you with a navigation plan as requested.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects Garage to Cellier
D2: Connects Cellier to Porche
D3: Connects Porche to Hall
D4: Connects Hall to WC
D5: Connects Hall to Lingerie
D6: Connects Hall to Bureau
D7: Connects Hall to Bains
D8: Connects Hall to Chambre Parents
D9: Connects Hall to Chambre Enfant 2
D10: Connects Hall to Chambre Enfant 1
D11: Connects Cellier to Hall

Now, I'll provide the step-by-step navigation plan to go from the Garage to the WC:

1. ApproachDoor(1)
2. OpenDoor(1)
3. GoThrough(1)
4. ApproachDoor(11)
5. OpenDoor(11)
6. GoThrough(11)
7. ApproachDoor(4)
8. OpenDoor(4)
9. GoThrough(4)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 11},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This path takes you from the Garage, through the Cellier and Hall, and finally to the WC, using only the necessary doors along the way.
