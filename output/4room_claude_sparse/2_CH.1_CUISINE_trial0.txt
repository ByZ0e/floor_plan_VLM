Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from CH.1 to CUISINE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CH.1 connects to SEJOUR through D5
2. SEJOUR connects to DEGT through D4
3. SEJOUR connects to PORCHE through D1
4. DEGT connects to CH.2 through D6
5. DEGT connects to CUISINE through D3
6. DEGT connects to WC through D8
7. BAINS connects to DEGT through D7
8. PORCHE connects to CELLIER through D2

Navigation Plan:
To get from CH.1 to CUISINE, we need to go through SEJOUR and DEGT. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(5)
2. OpenDoor(5)
3. GoThrough(5)
4. ApproachDoor(4)
5. OpenDoor(4)
6. GoThrough(4)
7. ApproachDoor(3)
8. OpenDoor(3)
9. GoThrough(3)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from CH.1 to CUISINE using only the necessary doors and rooms.
