Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan from CUISINE 1 to CELLIER.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CUISINE 1 - D31 - SEJOUR 1
2. SEJOUR 1 - D11 - PORCHE 1
3. PORCHE 1 - D10 - CELLIER
4. CELLIER - D2 - CUISINE
5. CUISINE - D3 - SEJOUR
6. SEJOUR - D1 - PORCHE

Navigation Plan:
To go from CUISINE 1 to CELLIER, we need to follow this path: CUISINE 1 -> SEJOUR 1 -> PORCHE 1 -> CELLIER

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CUISINE 1
2. Use D31 to go from CUISINE 1 to SEJOUR 1
3. Use D11 to go from SEJOUR 1 to PORCHE 1
4. Use D10 to go from PORCHE 1 to CELLIER

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CUISINE 1",
  "end": "CELLIER",
  "actions": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D31"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D31"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D31"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D10"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from CUISINE 1 to CELLIER, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
