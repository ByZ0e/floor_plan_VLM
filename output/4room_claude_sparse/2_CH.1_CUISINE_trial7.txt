Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan from CH.1 to CUISINE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CH.1 - D5 - DEGT
2. CH.1 - D4 - SEJOUR
3. SEJOUR - D1 - Porche
4. SEJOUR - D3 - CUISINE
5. DEGT - D6 - CH.2
6. DEGT - D7 - BAINS
7. DEGT - D8 - WC
8. Porche - D2 - CELLIER

Navigation Plan:
To go from CH.1 to CUISINE, we need to use the following doors: D5, D4, and D3.

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CH.1
2. Use D5 to enter DEGT
3. Use D4 to enter SEJOUR
4. Use D3 to enter CUISINE

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CH.1 to CUISINE using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
