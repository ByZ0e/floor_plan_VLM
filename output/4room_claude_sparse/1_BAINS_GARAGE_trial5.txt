Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and their door connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the BAINS to the GARAGE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. BAINS: Connected to HALL via D2
2. WC: Connected to HALL via D3
3. CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D4
4. CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL via D5
5. CELLIER: Connected to HALL via D1
6. GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER via D9
7. PORCHE: Connected to HALL via D6
8. CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D7
9. TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE via D8
10. HALL: Central area connected to multiple rooms

Navigation Plan:
To get from BAINS to GARAGE, we need to go through the HALL and CELLIER. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(D2)
2. OpenDoor(D2)
3. GoThrough(D2)
4. ApproachDoor(D1)
5. OpenDoor(D1)
6. GoThrough(D1)
7. ApproachDoor(D9)
8. OpenDoor(D9)
9. GoThrough(D9)

Here's the plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the BAINS to the GARAGE using only the necessary doors and rooms.
