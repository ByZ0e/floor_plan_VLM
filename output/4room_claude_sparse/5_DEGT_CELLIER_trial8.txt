Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from DEGT to CELLIER.

Room and Door Connections:
- DEGT: Connected to SEJOUR via D5, to CH.1 via D6, to BAINS via D7
- SEJOUR: Connected to DEGT via D5, to CUISINE via D3, to Porche via D1
- CUISINE: Connected to SEJOUR via D3, to CELLIER via D2
- CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE via D2, to Porche via D10
- Porche: Connected to SEJOUR via D1, to CELLIER via D10
- CH.1: Connected to DEGT via D6
- BAINS: Connected to DEGT via D7
- CH.2: Connected to DEGT via D8, to CH.4 via D9
- CH.4: Connected to CH.2 via D9

Navigation Plan:
1. ApproachDoor(D5)
2. OpenDoor(D5)
3. GoThrough(D5)
4. ApproachDoor(D3)
5. OpenDoor(D3)
6. GoThrough(D3)
7. ApproachDoor(D2)
8. OpenDoor(D2)
9. GoThrough(D2)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from DEGT to CELLIER using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
