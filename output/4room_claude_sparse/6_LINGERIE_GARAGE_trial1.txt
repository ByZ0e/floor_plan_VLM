Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the LINGERIE to the GARAGE.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER
D2: Connects CELLIER and PORCHE
D3: Connects PORCHE and LINGERIE
D4: Connects LINGERIE and WC
D5: Connects WC and BUREAU
D6: Connects BUREAU and BAINS
D7: Connects BAINS and CHAMBRE PARENTS
D8: Connects CHAMBRE PARENTS and HALL
D9: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
D10: Connects CHAMBRE ENFANT 2 and CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
D11: Connects CELLIER and HALL
D12: Connects the two sections of the HALL

Navigation Plan:
To go from LINGERIE to GARAGE, we need to use the following sequence of actions:

1. ApproachDoor(D3)
2. OpenDoor(D3)
3. GoThrough(D3)
4. ApproachDoor(D2)
5. OpenDoor(D2)
6. GoThrough(D2)
7. ApproachDoor(D1)
8. OpenDoor(D1)
9. GoThrough(D1)

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the LINGERIE to the GARAGE using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
