Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the connections and provide a navigation plan as requested.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects Garage to Cellier
D2: Connects Cellier to Porche
D3: Connects Porche to Lingerie
D4: Connects Lingerie to WC
D5: Connects Lingerie to Bureau
D6: Connects Bureau to Bains
D7: Connects Bains to Chambre Parents
D8: Connects Chambre Parents to Chambre Enfant 2
D9: Connects Chambre Enfant 2 to Chambre Enfant 1
D10: Connects Chambre Enfant 1 to Hall
D11: Connects Cellier to Hall

Step-by-step solution:

1. Start in Garage
2. Use D1 to enter Cellier
3. Use D11 to enter Hall
4. Use D10 to enter Chambre Enfant 1 (destination)

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 11},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 10}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the Garage to Chambre Enfant 1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
