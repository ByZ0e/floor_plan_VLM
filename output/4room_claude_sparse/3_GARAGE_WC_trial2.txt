Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from the GARAGE to the WC.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER
- D2: Connects CELLIER to PORCHE
- D3: Connects PORCHE to LINGERIE
- D4: Connects LINGERIE to WC
- D5: Connects LINGERIE to BUREAU
- D6: Connects BUREAU to BAINS
- D7: Connects BAINS to CHAMBRE PARENTS
- D8: Connects CHAMBRE PARENTS to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
- D9: Connects CHAMBRE ENFANT 2 to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
- D10: Connects CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 to HALL
- D11: Connects CELLIER to HALL

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in GARAGE
2. ApproachDoor(1)
3. OpenDoor(1)
4. GoThrough(1) to enter CELLIER
5. ApproachDoor(2)
6. OpenDoor(2)
7. GoThrough(2) to enter PORCHE
8. ApproachDoor(3)
9. OpenDoor(3)
10. GoThrough(3) to enter LINGERIE
11. ApproachDoor(4)
12. OpenDoor(4)
13. GoThrough(4) to enter WC (destination reached)

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct route from the GARAGE to the WC, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
