Certainly! I'll provide a clear list of rooms and doors with their connections, and then create a detailed navigation plan based on that information.

Room and Door Connections:

1. CHAMBRE PARENTS: Connected to HALL via D8
2. CHAMBRE ENFANT 2: Connected to HALL via D9
3. CHAMBRE ENFANT 1: Connected to HALL via D10
4. BAINS: Connected to HALL via D7
5. BUREAU: Connected to HALL via D6
6. LINGERIE: Connected to HALL via D5
7. WC: Connected to PORCHE via D4
8. PORCHE: Connected to HALL via D3, to CELLIER via D2
9. CELLIER: Connected to GARAGE via D1
10. GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER via D1

Now, let's create the navigation plan from CHAMBRE PARENTS to GARAGE:

Step 1: Exit CHAMBRE PARENTS
ApproachDoor(8)
OpenDoor(8)
GoThrough(8)

Step 2: Move through HALL to PORCHE
ApproachDoor(3)
OpenDoor(3)
GoThrough(3)

Step 3: Move from PORCHE to CELLIER
ApproachDoor(2)
OpenDoor(2)
GoThrough(2)

Step 4: Enter GARAGE from CELLIER
ApproachDoor(1)
OpenDoor(1)
GoThrough(1)

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides an efficient route from CHAMBRE PARENTS to GARAGE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
