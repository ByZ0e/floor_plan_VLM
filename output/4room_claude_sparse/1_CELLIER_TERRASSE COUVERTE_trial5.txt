Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the CELLIER to the TERRASSE COUVERTE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
2. D2: Connects HALL to WC
3. D3: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
4. D4: Connects HALL to BAINS
5. D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 2
6. D6: Connects HALL to PORCHE
7. D7: Connects PORCHE to CUISINE
8. D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
9. D9: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE

Navigation Plan:
To go from the CELLIER to the TERRASSE COUVERTE, we need to use the following path:
CELLIER -> D1 -> HALL -> D6 -> PORCHE -> D7 -> CUISINE -> D8 -> TERRASSE COUVERTE

Here's the step-by-step navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from the CELLIER to the TERRASSE COUVERTE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
