Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from LINGERIE to GARAGE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. LINGERIE - D41 - WC1
2. WC1 - D51 - BUREAU1
3. BUREAU1 - D61 - BAINS1
4. BAINS1 - D71 - CHAMBRE PARENTS1
5. CHAMBRE PARENTS1 - D81 - HALL 1
6. HALL 1 - D111 - CELLIER 1
7. CELLIER 1 - D13 - GARAGE 1

Navigation Plan:
To go from LINGERIE to GARAGE, we need to follow this path: LINGERIE -> WC1 -> BUREAU1 -> BAINS1 -> CHAMBRE PARENTS1 -> HALL 1 -> CELLIER 1 -> GARAGE 1

Here's the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D41"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D41"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D41"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D51"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D51"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D51"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D71"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D71"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D71"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D81"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D81"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D81"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D111"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D111"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D111"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D13"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D13"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D13"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the LINGERIE to the GARAGE using only the necessary doors and rooms.
