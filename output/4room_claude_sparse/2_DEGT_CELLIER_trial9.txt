Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from DEGT to CELLIER.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects Porche and SEJOUR
2. D2: Connects SEJOUR and CELLIER
3. D3: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
4. D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
5. D5: Connects DEGT and CH.1
6. D6: Connects DEGT and CH.2
7. D7: Connects DEGT and BAINS
8. D8: Connects DEGT and WC

Navigation Plan:
To go from DEGT to CELLIER, we need to use two doors: D4 and D2. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(4)
2. OpenDoor(4)
3. GoThrough(4)
4. ApproachDoor(2)
5. OpenDoor(2)
6. GoThrough(2)

Here's the plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "DEGT",
  "end": "CELLIER",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from DEGT to CELLIER using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
