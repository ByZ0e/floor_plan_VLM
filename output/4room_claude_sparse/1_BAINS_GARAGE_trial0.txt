Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the BAINS to the GARAGE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects CELLIER and HALL
2. D2: Connects BAINS and HALL
3. D3: Connects WC and HALL
4. D4: Connects CHAMBRE 1 and HALL
5. D5: Connects CHAMBRE 2 and HALL
6. D6: Connects PORCHE and HALL
7. D7: Connects CUISINE and HALL
8. D8: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
9. D9: Connects CELLIER and GARAGE

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in BAINS
2. Use D2 to enter HALL
3. Use D1 to enter CELLIER
4. Use D9 to reach GARAGE

Now, I'll provide the detailed navigation plan in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 9}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the BAINS to the GARAGE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
