Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the CUISINE to CH.2.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CUISINE: Connected to SEJOUR via D3
2. SEJOUR: Connected to CUISINE via D3, to DEGT via D4, to Porche via D1
3. DEGT: Connected to SEJOUR via D4, to CH.1 via D5, to CH.2 via D6, to BAINS via D7
4. CH.1: Connected to DEGT via D5
5. CH.2: Connected to DEGT via D6
6. BAINS: Connected to DEGT via D7
7. Porche: Connected to SEJOUR via D1, to CELLIER via D2
8. CELLIER: Connected to Porche via D2

Navigation Plan from CUISINE to CH.2:
1. ApproachDoor(D3)
2. OpenDoor(D3)
3. GoThrough(D3)
4. ApproachDoor(D4)
5. OpenDoor(D4)
6. GoThrough(D4)
7. ApproachDoor(D6)
8. OpenDoor(D6)
9. GoThrough(D6)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan will efficiently guide you from the CUISINE to CH.2 using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
