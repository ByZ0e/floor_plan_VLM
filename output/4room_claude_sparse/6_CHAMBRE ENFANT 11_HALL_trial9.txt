Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from CHAMBRE ENFANT 11 to HALL 1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CHAMBRE ENFANT 11 - D101 - HALL 1
2. HALL 1 - D111 - CELLIER 1
3. CELLIER 1 - D31 - PORCHE1
4. PORCHE1 - D21 - GARAGE 1

Navigation Plan:

To get from CHAMBRE ENFANT 11 to HALL 1, we only need to use one door: D101. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(101)
2. OpenDoor(101)
3. GoThrough(101)

Now, let's format this as JSON:

```json
{
  "start": "CHAMBRE ENFANT 11",
  "end": "HALL 1",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 101},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 101},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 101}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from CHAMBRE ENFANT 11 to HALL 1, using only the necessary door (D101) and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
