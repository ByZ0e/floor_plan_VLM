Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the CUISINE to CH.2.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects Porche and Sejour
2. D2: Connects Cellier and Sejour
3. D3: Connects Sejour and Cuisine
4. D4: Connects Sejour and Degt
5. D5: Connects CH.1 and Degt
6. D6: Connects CH.1 and CH.2
7. D7: Connects Degt and Bains
8. D8: Connects Degt and WC

Navigation Plan:
To go from CUISINE to CH.2, we need to use doors D3, D4, and D6. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. Start in CUISINE
2. ApproachDoor(D3)
3. OpenDoor(D3)
4. GoThrough(D3) [Now in SEJOUR]
5. ApproachDoor(D4)
6. OpenDoor(D4)
7. GoThrough(D4) [Now in DEGT]
8. ApproachDoor(D6)
9. OpenDoor(D6)
10. GoThrough(D6) [Now in CH.2]

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(D3)",
    "OpenDoor(D3)",
    "GoThrough(D3)",
    "ApproachDoor(D4)",
    "OpenDoor(D4)",
    "GoThrough(D4)",
    "ApproachDoor(D6)",
    "OpenDoor(D6)",
    "GoThrough(D6)"
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the CUISINE to CH.2 using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
