Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the GARAGE to the WC.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D9: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER
2. D1: Connects CELLIER and HALL
3. D2: Connects HALL and BAINS
4. D3: Connects HALL and WC

Navigation Plan:

To navigate from the GARAGE to the WC, we need to go through the following sequence of rooms: GARAGE -> CELLIER -> HALL -> WC. Here's the detailed plan:

1. ApproachDoor(9)
2. OpenDoor(9)
3. GoThrough(9)
4. ApproachDoor(1)
5. OpenDoor(1)
6. GoThrough(1)
7. ApproachDoor(3)
8. OpenDoor(3)
9. GoThrough(3)

Now, I'll provide the plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "doorNumber": 9},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "doorNumber": 9},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "doorNumber": 9},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "doorNumber": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "doorNumber": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "doorNumber": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "doorNumber": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "doorNumber": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "doorNumber": 3}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the GARAGE to the WC using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
