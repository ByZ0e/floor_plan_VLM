Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the CELLIER to the TERRASSE COUVERTE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CELLIER: Connected to HALL via D1
2. GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER via D9
3. CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL via D5
4. BAINS: Connected to HALL via D1
5. WC: Connected to HALL via D2
6. CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D4
7. HALL: Central area connecting multiple rooms
8. PORCHE: Connected to HALL via D6
9. CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D7
10. TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE via D8

Navigation Plan:
To get from the CELLIER to the TERRASSE COUVERTE, we need to go through the HALL and CUISINE. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. Start in CELLIER
2. ApproachDoor(D1)
3. OpenDoor(D1)
4. GoThrough(D1) // Now in HALL
5. ApproachDoor(D7)
6. OpenDoor(D7)
7. GoThrough(D7) // Now in CUISINE
8. ApproachDoor(D8)
9. OpenDoor(D8)
10. GoThrough(D8) // Now in TERRASSE COUVERTE

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from the CELLIER to the TERRASSE COUVERTE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
