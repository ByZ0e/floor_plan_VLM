Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. Let me analyze the layout and provide you with the necessary information and navigation plan.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

Rooms:
- DEGT
- SEJOUR
- CH.1
- CH.2
- CUISINE
- BAINS
- WC
- CELLIER
- Porche

Doors and their connections:
D1: Connects Porche and SEJOUR
D2: Connects CELLIER and SEJOUR
D3: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
D5: Connects DEGT and CH.1
D6: Connects DEGT and CH.2
D7: Connects DEGT and BAINS
D8: Connects DEGT and WC

Now, let's create the navigation plan to go from DEGT to CELLIER:

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in DEGT
2. Use D4 to enter SEJOUR
3. Use D2 to enter CELLIER

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D2"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D2"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D2"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from DEGT to CELLIER, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or actions.
