Thank you for providing the floor plan image and the navigation task. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a detailed navigation plan for you to move from DEGT 1 to DEGT.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D31 connects SEJOUR1 and CUISINE1
2. D41 connects SEJOUR1 and DEGT1
3. D51 connects DEGT1 and CH.3
4. D61 connects DEGT1 and BAINS1
5. D71 connects BAINS1 and CH.4
6. D9 connects CH.2 and CH.4
7. D5 connects DEGT and CH.1
8. D6 connects DEGT and BAINS
7. D7 connects BAINS and CH.2
8. D8 connects DEGT and BAINS
9. D4 connects SEJOUR and DEGT
10. D3 connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
11. D2 connects SEJOUR and CELLIER
12. D1 connects SEJOUR and Porche
13. D10 connects CELLIER and CELLIER1
14. D11 connects Porche1 and CELLIER1
15. D21 connects Porche1 and CUISINE1

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in DEGT1
2. Go through D41 to enter SEJOUR1
3. Go through D10 to enter CELLIER
4. Go through D4 to enter DEGT

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D41"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D41"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D41"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates you from DEGT1 to DEGT using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
