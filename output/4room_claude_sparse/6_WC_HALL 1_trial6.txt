Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide you with a detailed navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
1. WC connects to Lingerie via D4
2. Lingerie connects to Bureau via D5
3. Bureau connects to Hall via D6
4. Hall connects to Chambre Enfant 1 via D10
5. Hall connects to Chambre Enfant 2 via D9
6. Hall connects to Bains via D7
7. Hall connects to Chambre Parents via D8
8. Hall connects to Cellier via D11
9. Cellier connects to Garage via D1
10. Cellier connects to Porche via D3
11. Porche connects to Garage via D2

Now, let's create the navigation plan to go from WC to Hall 1:

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in WC
2. Go through D4 to enter Lingerie
3. Go through D5 to enter Bureau
4. Go through D6 to reach Hall 1 (destination)

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "doorNumber": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "doorNumber": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "doorNumber": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "doorNumber": 5
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "doorNumber": 5
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "doorNumber": 5
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "doorNumber": 6
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "doorNumber": 6
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "doorNumber": 6
    }
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan will efficiently guide you from the WC to Hall 1 using only the necessary doors and rooms.
