Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan from LINGERIE to GARAGE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. LINGERIE connects to HALL via D51/D5
2. HALL connects to CELLIER via D111/D11
3. CELLIER connects to GARAGE via D13/D1
4. PORCHE1/PORCHE connects to GARAGE via D21/D2

Navigation Plan:

To go from LINGERIE to GARAGE, we need to follow this path:
LINGERIE -> HALL -> CELLIER -> GARAGE

Here's the detailed action plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D51"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D51"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D51"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D111"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D111"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D111"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D13"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D13"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D13"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates you from the LINGERIE to the GARAGE using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours. The plan takes into account that doors close after each GoThrough action, so each door is approached, opened, and gone through in sequence.
