Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the PORCHE to the BAINS.

Rooms and Doors with Connections:

1. PORCHE: Connected to SEJOUR via D1
2. CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE via D2
3. SEJOUR: Connected to PORCHE via D1, to CUISINE via D3, to CH.1 via D4
4. CUISINE: Connected to CELLIER via D2, to SEJOUR via D3, to DEGT via D8
5. CH.1: Connected to SEJOUR via D4, to DEGT via D5
6. CH.2: Connected to DEGT via D6
7. DEGT: Connected to CH.1 via D5, to CH.2 via D6, to BAINS via D7, to CUISINE via D8
8. BAINS: Connected to DEGT via D7

Navigation Plan:

1. ApproachDoor(D1)
2. OpenDoor(D1)
3. GoThrough(D1)
4. ApproachDoor(D3)
5. OpenDoor(D3)
6. GoThrough(D3)
7. ApproachDoor(D8)
8. OpenDoor(D8)
9. GoThrough(D8)
10. ApproachDoor(D7)
11. OpenDoor(D7)
12. GoThrough(D7)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"}
  ]
}
```

This path takes you from the PORCHE through the SEJOUR, CUISINE, and DEGT to reach the BAINS, using only the necessary doors along the way.
