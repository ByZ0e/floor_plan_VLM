Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. Let's start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections based on the image:

Room and Door Connections:
1. WC 1 connects to DEGT 1 through door D81
2. DEGT 1 connects to SEJOUR1 through door D51
3. SEJOUR1 connects to CUISINE through door D3
4. CUISINE connects to CELLIER through door D2
5. CELLIER connects to CH.2 through door D10

Now, let's create the step-by-step navigation plan based on these connections:

1. Start in WC 1
2. ApproachDoor(D81)
3. OpenDoor(D81)
4. GoThrough(D81) to enter DEGT 1
5. ApproachDoor(D51)
6. OpenDoor(D51)
7. GoThrough(D51) to enter SEJOUR1
8. ApproachDoor(D3)
9. OpenDoor(D3)
10. GoThrough(D3) to enter CUISINE
11. ApproachDoor(D2)
12. OpenDoor(D2)
13. GoThrough(D2) to enter CELLIER
14. ApproachDoor(D10)
15. OpenDoor(D10)
16. GoThrough(D10) to enter CH.2

Now, let's present this plan in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D81"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D81"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D81"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D51"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D51"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D51"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D10"}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan will efficiently guide you from WC 1 to CH.2 using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
