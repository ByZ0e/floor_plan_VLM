Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from BAINS to GARAGE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects CELLIER and HALL
2. D2: Connects BAINS and HALL
3. D3: Connects WC and HALL
4. D4: Connects CHAMBRE 1 and HALL
5. D5: Connects CHAMBRE 2 and HALL
6. D6: Connects PORCHE and HALL
7. D7: Connects CUISINE and HALL
8. D8: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
9. D9: Connects CELLIER and GARAGE

Navigation Plan:
To go from BAINS to GARAGE, we need to pass through the HALL and CELLIER. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(D2)
2. OpenDoor(D2)
3. GoThrough(D2)
4. ApproachDoor(D1)
5. OpenDoor(D1)
6. GoThrough(D1)
7. ApproachDoor(D9)
8. OpenDoor(D9)
9. GoThrough(D9)

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from BAINS to GARAGE using only the necessary doors and rooms.
