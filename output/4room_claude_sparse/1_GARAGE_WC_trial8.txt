Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from the GARAGE to the WC.

Rooms and Door Connections:
1. GARAGE - connects to CELLIER via D9
2. CELLIER - connects to GARAGE via D9, to HALL via D1
3. HALL - connects to CELLIER via D1, to BAINS via D2, to CHAMBRE 1 via D4, to CHAMBRE 2 via D5, to PORCHE via D6
4. BAINS - connects to HALL via D2, to WC via D3
5. WC - connects to BAINS via D3
6. CHAMBRE 1 - connects to HALL via D4
7. CHAMBRE 2 - connects to HALL via D5
8. PORCHE - connects to HALL via D6, to CUISINE via D7
9. CUISINE - connects to PORCHE via D7, to TERRASSE COUVERTE via D8
10. TERRASSE COUVERTE - connects to CUISINE via D8

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in GARAGE
2. ApproachDoor(D9)
3. OpenDoor(D9)
4. GoThrough(D9) - Now in CELLIER
5. ApproachDoor(D1)
6. OpenDoor(D1)
7. GoThrough(D1) - Now in HALL
8. ApproachDoor(D2)
9. OpenDoor(D2)
10. GoThrough(D2) - Now in BAINS
11. ApproachDoor(D3)
12. OpenDoor(D3)
13. GoThrough(D3) - Now in WC (destination reached)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"}
  ]
}
```

This path efficiently navigates from the GARAGE to the WC using only the necessary doors and rooms.
