Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the room and door connections, then provide a navigation plan from the GARAGE to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER
- D2: Connects CELLIER and PORCHE
- D3: Connects PORCHE and LINGERIE
- D4: Connects LINGERIE and WC
- D5: Connects LINGERIE and BUREAU
- D6: Connects BUREAU and BAINS
- D7: Connects BAINS and CHAMBRE PARENTS
- D8: Connects CHAMBRE PARENTS and CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
- D9: Connects CHAMBRE ENFANT 2 and CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
- D10: Connects CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 and HALL
- D11: Connects CELLIER and HALL

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in GARAGE
2. Use D1 to enter CELLIER
3. Use D11 to enter HALL
4. Use D10 to reach CHAMBRE ENFANT 1

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 11},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 10}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the GARAGE to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
