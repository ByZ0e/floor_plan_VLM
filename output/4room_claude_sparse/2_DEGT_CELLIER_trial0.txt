Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan from DEGT to CELLIER.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

Rooms:
- Porche
- CELLIER
- SEJOUR
- CUISINE
- WC
- BAINS
- DEGT
- CH.1
- CH.2

Doors and their connections:
D1: Connects Porche and SEJOUR
D2: Connects CELLIER and SEJOUR
D3: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
D5: Connects DEGT and CH.1
D6: Connects DEGT and CH.2
D7: Connects DEGT and BAINS
D8: Connects DEGT and WC

Navigation Plan:
To go from DEGT to CELLIER, we need to use doors D4 and D2. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(4)
2. OpenDoor(4)
3. GoThrough(4)
4. ApproachDoor(2)
5. OpenDoor(2)
6. GoThrough(2)

Now, let's provide this plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "DEGT",
  "end": "CELLIER",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from DEGT to CELLIER using only the necessary doors and actions.
