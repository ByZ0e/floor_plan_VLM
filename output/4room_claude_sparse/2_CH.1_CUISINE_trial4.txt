Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan from CH.1 to CUISINE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CH.1 connects to SEJOUR through D5
2. SEJOUR connects to CH.1 through D5
3. SEJOUR connects to DEGT through D4
4. DEGT connects to SEJOUR through D4
5. DEGT connects to CUISINE through D3
6. CUISINE connects to DEGT through D3

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
1. Start in CH.1
2. ApproachDoor(D5)
3. OpenDoor(D5)
4. GoThrough(D5) to enter SEJOUR
5. ApproachDoor(D4)
6. OpenDoor(D4)
7. GoThrough(D4) to enter DEGT
8. ApproachDoor(D3)
9. OpenDoor(D3)
10. GoThrough(D3) to enter CUISINE

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CH.1",
  "end": "CUISINE",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from CH.1 to CUISINE using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
