Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from DEGT 1 to DEGT.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D51 connects DEGT 1 and SEJOUR 1
2. D41 connects SEJOUR 1 and CH.3
3. D9 connects CH.3 and CH.2
4. D5 connects CH.2 and DEGT

Navigation Plan:
To go from DEGT 1 to DEGT, we need to follow this path: DEGT 1 -> SEJOUR 1 -> CH.3 -> CH.2 -> DEGT

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in DEGT 1
2. Use D51 to enter SEJOUR 1
3. Use D41 to enter CH.3
4. Use D9 to enter CH.2
5. Use D5 to reach DEGT (final destination)

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D51"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D51"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D51"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D41"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D41"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D41"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from DEGT 1 to DEGT, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
