Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and door connections, and then provide a detailed navigation plan.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

1. CHAMBRE ENFANT 11 connects to HALL 1 via D101
2. HALL 1 connects to:
   - CHAMBRE ENFANT 21 via D91
   - CHAMBRE PARENTS1 via D81
   - BAINS1 via D71
   - BUREAU1 via D61
   - LINGERIE1 via D51
   - WC1 via D41
   - PORCHE1 via D31
   - CELLIER 1 via D111

Navigation Plan:

To navigate from CHAMBRE ENFANT 11 to HALL 1, we only need to use one door. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(101)
2. OpenDoor(101)
3. GoThrough(101)

This sequence will take you directly from CHAMBRE ENFANT 11 to HALL 1.

JSON format of the final path:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 101},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 101},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 101}
  ]
}
```

This is the most efficient and correct path to reach the HALL from CHAMBRE ENFANT 11 based on the provided floor plan. The plan uses only the necessary door (D101) to achieve the navigation task.
