Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from CUISINE 1 to CELLIER.

Room and Door Connections:
- D31: Connects CUISINE1 and SEJOUR1
- D21: Connects CELLIER1 and PORCHE1
- D11: Connects PORCHE1 and SEJOUR1
- D10: Connects SEJOUR1 and CELLIER
- D2: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
- D3: Connects CUISINE and SEJOUR

Navigation Plan:
To go from CUISINE1 to CELLIER, we need to:
1. Exit CUISINE1 through D31 to SEJOUR1
2. Cross SEJOUR1 to D10
3. Go through D10 to reach CELLIER

Here's the detailed action plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D31"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D31"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D31"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D10"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D10"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D10"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from CUISINE1 to CELLIER using only the necessary doors.
