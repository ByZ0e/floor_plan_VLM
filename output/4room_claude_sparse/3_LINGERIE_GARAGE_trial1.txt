Certainly! I'll analyze the floor plan, list the room and door connections, and then provide a detailed navigation plan for you to move from the LINGERIE to the GARAGE.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:
- D1: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER
- D2: Connects CELLIER and PORCHE
- D3: Connects PORCHE and LINGERIE
- D4: Connects LINGERIE and WC
- D5: Connects LINGERIE and BUREAU
- D6: Connects BUREAU and BAINS
- D7: Connects BAINS and CHAMBRE PARENTS
- D8: Connects CHAMBRE PARENTS and CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
- D9: Connects CHAMBRE ENFANT 2 and HALL
- D10: Connects CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 and HALL
- D11: Connects CELLIER and HALL

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in LINGERIE
2. Use D3 to enter PORCHE
3. Use D2 to enter CELLIER
4. Use D1 to enter GARAGE

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from the LINGERIE to the GARAGE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
