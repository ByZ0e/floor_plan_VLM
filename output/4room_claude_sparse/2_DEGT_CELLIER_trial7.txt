Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan for you to move from DEGT to CELLIER.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects Porche and SEJOUR
2. D2: Connects SEJOUR and CELLIER
3. D3: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
4. D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
5. D5: Connects DEGT and CH.1
6. D6: Connects DEGT and CH.2
7. D7: Connects DEGT and BAINS
8. D8: Connects DEGT and WC

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
1. Start in DEGT
2. Use D4 to enter SEJOUR
3. Use D2 to enter CELLIER

Here's the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D2"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D2"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D2"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from DEGT to CELLIER using only the necessary doors. The robot will start in DEGT, go through D4 to enter SEJOUR, and then use D2 to reach the final destination, CELLIER.
