Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the GARAGE to the BUREAU.

Room and Door Connections:
1. GARAGE 1 <-> D1 <-> CELLIER 1
2. CELLIER 1 <-> D21 <-> PORCHE1
3. PORCHE1 <-> D31 <-> WC1
4. WC1 <-> D41 <-> LINGERIE1
5. LINGERIE1 <-> D51 <-> BUREAU1

Step-by-step Solution:
1. Start in GARAGE 1
2. Use D1 to enter CELLIER 1
3. Use D21 to enter PORCHE1
4. Use D31 to enter WC1
5. Use D41 to enter LINGERIE1
6. Use D51 to enter BUREAU1

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D21"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D21"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D21"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D31"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D31"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D31"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D41"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D41"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D41"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D51"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D51"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D51"}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan will efficiently guide you from the GARAGE to the BUREAU using only the necessary doors along the path.
