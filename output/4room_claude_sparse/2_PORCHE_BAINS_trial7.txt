Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the PORCHE to the BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
1. PORCHE connects to SEJOUR through D1
2. CELLIER connects to CUISINE through D2
3. SEJOUR connects to CUISINE through D3
4. SEJOUR connects to DEGT through D4
5. CH.1 connects to DEGT through D5
6. CH.2 connects to DEGT through D6
7. DEGT connects to BAINS through D7
8. DEGT connects to WC through D8

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in PORCHE
2. Use D1 to enter SEJOUR
3. Cross SEJOUR to D4
4. Use D4 to enter DEGT
5. In DEGT, approach D7
6. Use D7 to enter BAINS

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the PORCHE to the BAINS, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
