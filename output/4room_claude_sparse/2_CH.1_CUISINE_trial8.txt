Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from CH.1 to CUISINE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CH.1 connects to SEJOUR through D5
2. SEJOUR connects to DEGT through D4
3. SEJOUR connects to CUISINE through D3
4. DEGT connects to CH.2 through D6
5. DEGT connects to BAINS through D7
6. DEGT connects to WC through D8
7. SEJOUR connects to Porche through D1
8. Porche connects to CELLIER through D2

Now, let's create the navigation plan from CH.1 to CUISINE:

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CH.1
2. Use D5 to enter SEJOUR
3. From SEJOUR, use D3 to enter CUISINE

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from CH.1 to CUISINE, using only the necessary doors (D5 and D3) to reach the destination.
