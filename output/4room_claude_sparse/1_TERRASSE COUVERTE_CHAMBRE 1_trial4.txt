Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to CHAMBRE 1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D8: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE and CUISINE
2. D7: Connects CUISINE and HALL
3. D6: Connects PORCHE and HALL
4. D5: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 2
5. D4: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 1
6. D3: Connects HALL and WC
7. D2: Connects WC and BAINS
8. D1: Connects HALL and CELLIER
9. D9: Connects CELLIER and GARAGE

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in TERRASSE COUVERTE
2. ApproachDoor(D8)
3. OpenDoor(D8)
4. GoThrough(D8) to enter CUISINE
5. ApproachDoor(D7)
6. OpenDoor(D7)
7. GoThrough(D7) to enter HALL
8. ApproachDoor(D4)
9. OpenDoor(D4)
10. GoThrough(D4) to enter CHAMBRE 1

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to CHAMBRE 1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
