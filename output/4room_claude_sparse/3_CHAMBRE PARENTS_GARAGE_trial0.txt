I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections based on the floor plan image:

Room and Door Connections:
1. CHAMBRE PARENTS: Connected to HALL via D8
2. BAINS: Connected to HALL via D7
3. BUREAU: Connected to HALL via D6
4. LINGERIE: Connected to HALL via D5
5. WC: Connected to PORCHE via D4
6. PORCHE: Connected to CELLIER via D3, to WC via D4
7. CELLIER: Connected to PORCHE via D3, to GARAGE via D1, to HALL via D11
8. GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER via D1
9. HALL: Connected to CHAMBRE PARENTS via D8, to BAINS via D7, to BUREAU via D6, to LINGERIE via D5, to CELLIER via D11
10. CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 and CHAMBRE ENFANT 2: Not relevant for this path

Now, I'll provide the step-by-step navigation plan from CHAMBRE PARENTS to GARAGE:

1. Start in CHAMBRE PARENTS
2. ApproachDoor(D8)
3. OpenDoor(D8)
4. GoThrough(D8) - Now in HALL
5. ApproachDoor(D11)
6. OpenDoor(D11)
7. GoThrough(D11) - Now in CELLIER
8. ApproachDoor(D1)
9. OpenDoor(D1)
10. GoThrough(D1) - Now in GARAGE

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(D8)",
    "OpenDoor(D8)",
    "GoThrough(D8)",
    "ApproachDoor(D11)",
    "OpenDoor(D11)",
    "GoThrough(D11)",
    "ApproachDoor(D1)",
    "OpenDoor(D1)",
    "GoThrough(D1)"
  ]
}
```

This path efficiently navigates from CHAMBRE PARENTS to GARAGE using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
