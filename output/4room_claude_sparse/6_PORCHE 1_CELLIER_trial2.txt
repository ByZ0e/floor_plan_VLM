Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and their door connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from PORCHE1 to CELLIER 1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. PORCHE1 - D21 connects to GARAGE 1, D31 connects to CELLIER 1
2. GARAGE 1 - D13 connects to CELLIER 1
3. CELLIER 1 - D31 connects to PORCHE1, D13 connects to GARAGE 1, D111 connects to HALL 1

Navigation Plan:
To get from PORCHE1 to CELLIER 1, we need to use door D31. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(31)
2. OpenDoor(31)
3. GoThrough(31)

Here's the plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "PORCHE1",
  "end": "CELLIER 1",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 31},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 31},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 31}
  ]
}
```

This is the most direct and efficient path from PORCHE1 to CELLIER 1, using only the necessary door (D31) that connects these two rooms directly.
