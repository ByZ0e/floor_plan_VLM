Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from the WC to the PORCHE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. WC: Connected to DEGT via D8
2. DEGT: Connected to WC via D8, SEJOUR via D4, CH.1 via D6
3. SEJOUR: Connected to DEGT via D4, CUISINE via D3, PORCHE via D1
4. CUISINE: Connected to SEJOUR via D3
5. PORCHE: Connected to SEJOUR via D1
6. CH.1: Connected to DEGT via D6
7. CH.2: No direct door connections
8. BAINS: No direct door connections
9. CELLIER: Connected to PORCHE via D2 (not needed for this route)

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in WC
2. ApproachDoor(8)
3. OpenDoor(8)
4. GoThrough(8) to enter DEGT
5. ApproachDoor(4)
6. OpenDoor(4)
7. GoThrough(4) to enter SEJOUR
8. ApproachDoor(1)
9. OpenDoor(1)
10. GoThrough(1) to reach PORCHE (final destination)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan provides the most efficient route from the WC to the PORCHE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
