Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the CUISINE to CH.2.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects Porche and Sejour
2. D2: Connects Cellier and Sejour
3. D3: Connects Cuisine and Sejour
4. D4: Connects Sejour and Degt
5. D5: Connects CH.1 and Degt
6. D6: Connects CH.1 and CH.2
7. D7: Connects Bains and Degt
8. D8: Connects Cuisine and Degt

Navigation Plan:
To go from CUISINE to CH.2, we need to use the following sequence of actions:

1. ApproachDoor(8)
2. OpenDoor(8)
3. GoThrough(8)
4. ApproachDoor(5)
5. OpenDoor(5)
6. GoThrough(5)
7. ApproachDoor(6)
8. OpenDoor(6)
9. GoThrough(6)

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CUISINE",
  "end": "CH.2",
  "actions": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6}
  ]
}
```

This plan takes you from the CUISINE through the Degt (using D8), then to CH.1 (using D5), and finally to CH.2 (using D6). This is the most efficient path based on the floor plan provided.
