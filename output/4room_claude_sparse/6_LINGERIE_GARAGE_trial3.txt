Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the LINGERIE to the GARAGE.

Room and Door Connections:

D4: Connects LINGERIE to WC
D5: Connects WC to BUREAU
D6: Connects BUREAU to BAINS
D7: Connects BAINS to HALL
D11: Connects HALL to CELLIER
D1: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE

Navigation Plan:

To get from LINGERIE to GARAGE, we need to go through the following sequence of rooms: LINGERIE -> WC -> BUREAU -> BAINS -> HALL -> CELLIER -> GARAGE.

Here's the step-by-step navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 11},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the LINGERIE to the GARAGE using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
