Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a detailed navigation plan from the GARAGE to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER
D2: Connects CELLIER to PORCHE
D3: Connects PORCHE to LINGERIE
D4: Connects LINGERIE to WC
D5: Connects LINGERIE to BUREAU
D6: Connects BUREAU to BAINS
D7: Connects BAINS to CHAMBRE PARENTS
D8: Connects CHAMBRE PARENTS to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
D9: Connects CHAMBRE ENFANT 2 to HALL
D10: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
D11: Connects CELLIER to HALL

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in GARAGE
2. Use D1 to enter CELLIER
3. Use D11 to enter HALL
4. Use D10 to reach CHAMBRE ENFANT 1

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 11},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 10}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the GARAGE to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
