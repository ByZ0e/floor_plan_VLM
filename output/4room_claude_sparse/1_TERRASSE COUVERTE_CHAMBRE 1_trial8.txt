Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a detailed navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:

D1: Connects CELLIER and HALL
D2: Connects BAINS and HALL
D3: Connects WC and HALL
D4: Connects CHAMBRE 1 and HALL
D5: Connects CHAMBRE 2 and HALL
D6: Connects PORCHE and HALL
D7: Connects CUISINE and HALL
D8: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE and CUISINE
D9: Connects CELLIER and GARAGE

Step-by-step navigation plan from TERRASSE COUVERTE to CHAMBRE 1:

1. Start in TERRASSE COUVERTE
2. Use D8 to enter CUISINE
3. Use D7 to enter HALL
4. Use D4 to enter CHAMBRE 1

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to CHAMBRE 1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
