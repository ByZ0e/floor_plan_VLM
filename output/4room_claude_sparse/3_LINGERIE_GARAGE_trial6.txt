Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list the rooms and doors with their connections, then create a navigation plan based on this information.

Room and Door Connections:
- Lingerie: connected to Hall via D5
- Hall: connected to Lingerie via D5, Cellier via D11, Chambre Enfant 1 via D10
- Cellier: connected to Hall via D11, Garage via D1, Porche via D2
- Garage: connected to Cellier via D1
- Porche: connected to Cellier via D2, WC via D3
- WC: connected to Porche via D3, D4 (leads to small space)
- Bureau: connected to Hall via D6
- Bains: connected to Hall via D7
- Chambre Parents: connected to Hall via D8
- Chambre Enfant 2: connected to Hall via D9
- Chambre Enfant 1: connected to Hall via D10

Navigation Plan:
To go from Lingerie to Garage, we need to follow these steps:
1. Exit Lingerie to Hall
2. Go from Hall to Cellier
3. Enter Garage from Cellier

Here's the detailed action plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the Lingerie to the Garage using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
