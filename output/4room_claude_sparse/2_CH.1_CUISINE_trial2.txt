Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms, doors, and their connections, then provide you with a detailed navigation plan from CH.1 to CUISINE.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

Rooms:
- CH.1
- CH.2
- SEJOUR
- CUISINE
- BAINS
- WC
- DEGT (likely "dégagement" or hallway)
- CELLIER
- Porche

Doors and their connections:
D1: Connects Porche and SEJOUR
D2: Connects CELLIER and SEJOUR
D3: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
D5: Connects CH.1 and DEGT
D6: Connects CH.2 and DEGT
D7: Connects DEGT and BAINS
D8: Connects DEGT and WC

Navigation Plan:
To go from CH.1 to CUISINE, we need to use doors D5, D4, and D3. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(5)
2. OpenDoor(5)
3. GoThrough(5)
4. ApproachDoor(4)
5. OpenDoor(4)
6. GoThrough(4)
7. ApproachDoor(3)
8. OpenDoor(3)
9. GoThrough(3)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently guide you from CH.1 to CUISINE using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
