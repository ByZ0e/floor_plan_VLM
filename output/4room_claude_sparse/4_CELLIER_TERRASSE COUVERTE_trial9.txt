Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a detailed navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:

1. CELLIER:
   - D9: Connects to GARAGE
   - D1: Connects to HALL

2. GARAGE:
   - D9: Connects to CELLIER

3. BAINS:
   - D2: Connects to HALL

4. WC:
   - D3: Connects to HALL

5. CHAMBRE 1:
   - D4: Connects to HALL

6. CHAMBRE 2:
   - D5: Connects to HALL

7. HALL:
   - D1: Connects to CELLIER
   - D2: Connects to BAINS
   - D3: Connects to WC
   - D4: Connects to CHAMBRE 1
   - D5: Connects to CHAMBRE 2
   - D6: Connects to PORCHE

8. PORCHE:
   - D6: Connects to HALL
   - D7: Connects to CUISINE

9. CUISINE:
   - D7: Connects to PORCHE
   - D8: Connects to TERRASSE COUVERTE

10. TERRASSE COUVERTE:
    - D8: Connects to CUISINE
    - D10: Connects to exterior (not relevant for this task)

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:

1. Start in CELLIER
2. ApproachDoor(D1)
3. OpenDoor(D1)
4. GoThrough(D1) to enter HALL
5. ApproachDoor(D6)
6. OpenDoor(D6)
7. GoThrough(D6) to enter PORCHE
8. ApproachDoor(D7)
9. OpenDoor(D7)
10. GoThrough(D7) to enter CUISINE
11. ApproachDoor(D8)
12. OpenDoor(D8)
13. GoThrough(D8) to reach TERRASSE COUVERTE

Final Navigation Plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CELLIER",
  "end": "TERRASSE COUVERTE",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan provides the most efficient path from the CELLIER to the TERRASSE COUVERTE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
