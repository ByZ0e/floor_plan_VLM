Certainly! I'll analyze the floor plan, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the GARAGE to the WC.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

1. GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER via D1
2. CELLIER: Connected to GARAGE via D1, to PORCHE via D2
3. PORCHE: Connected to CELLIER via D2, to LINGERIE via D3
4. LINGERIE: Connected to PORCHE via D3, to WC via D4, to BUREAU via D5
5. WC: Connected to LINGERIE via D4
6. BUREAU: Connected to LINGERIE via D5, to BAINS via D6
7. BAINS: Connected to BUREAU via D6, to CHAMBRE PARENTS via D7
8. CHAMBRE PARENTS: Connected to BAINS via D7, to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2 via D8
9. CHAMBRE ENFANT 2: Connected to CHAMBRE PARENTS via D8, to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 via D9
10. CHAMBRE ENFANT 1: Connected to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2 via D9
11. HALL: Connected to CELLIER via D11

Now, let's create the navigation plan from the GARAGE to the WC:

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in GARAGE
2. Use D1 to enter CELLIER
3. Use D2 to enter PORCHE
4. Use D3 to enter LINGERIE
5. Use D4 to enter WC (destination reached)

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 2
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 2
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 2
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 4
    }
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan provides the most efficient path from the GARAGE to the WC, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
