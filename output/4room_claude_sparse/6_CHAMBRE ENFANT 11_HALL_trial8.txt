Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll start by listing the relevant rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Relevant Room and Door Connections:
- CHAMBRE ENFANT 11 connects to HALL 1 via door D101
- HALL 1 is the destination

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
1. Start in CHAMBRE ENFANT 11
2. Approach door D101
3. Open door D101
4. Go through door D101 to enter HALL 1

Final Navigation Plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D101"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D101"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D101"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CHAMBRE ENFANT 11 to HALL 1 using only the necessary door D101. The robot will end up in HALL 1, which is the desired destination.
