Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan from DEGT 1 to DEGT.

Room and Door Connections:

1. DEGT 1 - D51 - CH.3
2. CH.3 - D41 - SEJOUR1
3. SEJOUR1 - D11 - Porche1
4. Porche1 - D10 - CELLIER
5. CELLIER - D2 - CUISINE
6. CUISINE - D3 - SEJOUR
7. SEJOUR - D4 - CH.1
8. CH.1 - D5 - DEGT

Navigation Plan:

To go from DEGT 1 to DEGT, we need to follow this path: DEGT 1 -> CH.3 -> SEJOUR1 -> Porche1 -> CELLIER -> CUISINE -> SEJOUR -> CH.1 -> DEGT

Here's the step-by-step navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D51"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D51"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D51"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D41"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D41"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D41"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from DEGT 1 to DEGT, using only the necessary doors and rooms based on the provided floor plan.
