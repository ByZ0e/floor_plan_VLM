Thank you for providing this detailed floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and their door connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan from the GARAGE to the WC.

Room and Door Connections:
1. GARAGE - D9 connects to CELLIER
2. CELLIER - D9 connects to GARAGE, D1 connects to HALL
3. HALL - D1 connects to CELLIER, D2 connects to WC, D3 connects to CHAMBRE 1, D5 connects to CHAMBRE 2, D6 connects to PORCHE
4. WC - D2 connects to HALL
5. CHAMBRE 1 - D3 connects to HALL
6. CHAMBRE 2 - D5 connects to HALL
7. PORCHE - D6 connects to HALL, D7 connects to CUISINE
8. CUISINE - D7 connects to PORCHE, D8 connects to TERRASSE COUVERTE

Step-by-step navigation plan from GARAGE to WC:
1. Start in GARAGE
2. ApproachDoor(D9)
3. OpenDoor(D9)
4. GoThrough(D9) - Now in CELLIER
5. ApproachDoor(D1)
6. OpenDoor(D1)
7. GoThrough(D1) - Now in HALL
8. ApproachDoor(D2)
9. OpenDoor(D2)
10. GoThrough(D2) - Now in WC (destination reached)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"}
  ]
}
```

This path efficiently navigates from the GARAGE to the WC using only the necessary doors and rooms.
