Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from DEGT to CELLIER.

Room and Door Connections:
1. DEGT connects to SEJOUR via D5
2. DEGT connects to CH.1 via D6
3. SEJOUR connects to CUISINE via D3
4. CUISINE connects to CELLIER via D2
5. SEJOUR connects to Porche via D1
6. BAINS connects to DEGT via D7
7. BAINS connects to CH.2 via D8
8. CH.2 connects to CH.4 via D9
9. CELLIER connects to Porche1 via D10
10. Porche1 connects to SEJOUR1 via D11
11. SEJOUR1 connects to CUISINE1 via D31
12. CUISINE1 connects to CELLIER1 via D21
13. BAINS 1 connects to DEGT 1 via D71
14. CH.3 connects to DEGT 1 via D61
15. CH.3 connects to SEJOUR1 via D51
16. DEGT 1 connects to SEJOUR1 via D41

Now, let's create the navigation plan to go from DEGT to CELLIER:

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in DEGT
2. Go to SEJOUR through D5
3. Go to CUISINE through D3
4. Go to CELLIER through D2

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from DEGT to CELLIER using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
