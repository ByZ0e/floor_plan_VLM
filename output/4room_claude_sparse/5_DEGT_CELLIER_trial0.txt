Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from DEGT to CELLIER.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

1. DEGT connects to SEJOUR via D5
2. DEGT connects to CH.1 via D6
3. SEJOUR connects to CUISINE via D3
4. SEJOUR connects to Porche via D2
5. CUISINE connects to CELLIER via D10
6. CELLIER connects to Porche via D1

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in DEGT
2. Go from DEGT to SEJOUR through D5
3. Go from SEJOUR to CUISINE through D3
4. Go from CUISINE to CELLIER through D10

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D10"}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan will efficiently guide you from the DEGT to the CELLIER using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
