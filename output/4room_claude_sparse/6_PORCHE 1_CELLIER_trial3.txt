Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. Let's start by listing the rooms and their door connections based on the image:

Room and Door Connections:
1. PORCHE1 connects to GARAGE1 via D21
2. PORCHE1 connects to CELLIER1 via D31
3. CELLIER1 connects to GARAGE1 via D13
4. CELLIER1 connects to HALL1 via D111

Now, let's create the navigation plan to go from PORCHE1 to CELLIER1:

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in PORCHE1
2. Use D31 to enter CELLIER1

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D31"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D31"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D31"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from PORCHE1 to CELLIER1 using only the necessary doors. The robot will approach door D31, open it, and go through it to reach the CELLIER1, which is the final destination.
