Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from CHAMBRE ENFANT 11 to HALL 1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D91 connects CHAMBRE ENFANT 11 and HALL 1
2. D101 connects CHAMBRE ENFANT 21 and HALL 1
3. D81 connects CHAMBRE PARENTS1 and HALL 1
4. D71 connects BAINS1 and HALL 1
5. D61 connects BUREAU1 and HALL 1
6. D51 connects LINGERIE1 and HALL 1
7. D41 connects WC1 and HALL 1
8. D31 connects PORCHE1 and CELLIER 1
9. D21 connects GARAGE 1 and PORCHE1
10. D13 connects GARAGE 1 and CELLIER 1
11. D111 connects CELLIER 1 and HALL 1

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CHAMBRE ENFANT 11
2. Use D91 to enter HALL 1

Navigation Plan:
```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 91},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 91},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 91}
  ]
}
```

This is the most efficient path from CHAMBRE ENFANT 11 to HALL 1, using only the necessary door (D91) to reach the destination.
