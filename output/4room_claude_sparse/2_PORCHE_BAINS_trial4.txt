Thank you for providing the floor plan image. I'll analyze the rooms and doors, create a list of connections, and then provide a navigation plan from PORCHE to BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects PORCHE to SEJOUR
- D2: Connects SEJOUR to CELLIER
- D3: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
- D4: Connects SEJOUR to DEGT (Dégagement/Hallway)
- D5: Connects DEGT to CH.1
- D6: Connects DEGT to CH.2
- D7: Connects DEGT to BAINS
- D8: Connects DEGT to WC

Step-by-step navigation plan from PORCHE to BAINS:
1. Start in PORCHE
2. Use D1 to enter SEJOUR
3. Cross SEJOUR to reach D4
4. Use D4 to enter DEGT
5. In DEGT, locate D7
6. Use D7 to reach BAINS

Now, I'll provide the detailed action sequence in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from PORCHE to BAINS, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
