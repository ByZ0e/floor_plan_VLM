Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan from the GARAGE to the WC.

Room and Door Connections:
- D9: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER
- D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
- D2: Connects HALL to BAINS
- D3: Connects BAINS to WC
- D4: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
- D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 2
- D6: Connects HALL to PORCHE
- D7: Connects PORCHE to CUISINE
- D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE

Step-by-step navigation plan from GARAGE to WC:
1. Start in GARAGE
2. ApproachDoor(9)
3. OpenDoor(9)
4. GoThrough(9) to enter CELLIER
5. ApproachDoor(1)
6. OpenDoor(1)
7. GoThrough(1) to enter HALL
8. ApproachDoor(2)
9. OpenDoor(2)
10. GoThrough(2) to enter BAINS
11. ApproachDoor(3)
12. OpenDoor(3)
13. GoThrough(3) to enter WC

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(9)",
    "OpenDoor(9)",
    "GoThrough(9)",
    "ApproachDoor(1)",
    "OpenDoor(1)",
    "GoThrough(1)",
    "ApproachDoor(2)",
    "OpenDoor(2)",
    "GoThrough(2)",
    "ApproachDoor(3)",
    "OpenDoor(3)",
    "GoThrough(3)"
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan provides the most efficient route from the GARAGE to the WC, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
