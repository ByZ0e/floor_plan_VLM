Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the GARAGE to the BUREAU.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER
2. D2: Connects CELLIER to PORCHE
3. D3: Connects PORCHE to LINGERIE
4. D4: Connects LINGERIE to WC (not needed for this path)
5. D5: Connects LINGERIE to BUREAU
6. D6: Connects BUREAU to BAINS (not needed for this path)
7. D7: Connects BAINS to CHAMBRE PARENTS (not needed for this path)
8. D8: Connects CHAMBRE PARENTS to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2 (not needed for this path)
9. D9: Connects CHAMBRE ENFANT 2 to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 (not needed for this path)
10. D10: Connects CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 to HALL (not needed for this path)
11. D11: Connects CELLIER to HALL (not needed for this path)

Navigation Plan:
To go from the GARAGE to the BUREAU, we need to use the following doors: D1, D2, D3, and D5.

Here's the step-by-step navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the GARAGE to the BUREAU using only the necessary doors along the path.
