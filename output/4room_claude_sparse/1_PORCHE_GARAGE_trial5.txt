Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the PORCHE to the GARAGE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D6: Connects PORCHE and HALL
2. D7: Connects CUISINE and HALL
3. D8: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
4. D5: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 2
5. D4: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 1
6. D3: Connects HALL and WC
7. D2: Connects WC and BAINS
8. D1: Connects HALL and CELLIER
9. D9: Connects CELLIER and GARAGE

Navigation Plan:
To go from the PORCHE to the GARAGE, we need to pass through the HALL and CELLIER. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(D6)
2. OpenDoor(D6)
3. GoThrough(D6)
4. ApproachDoor(D1)
5. OpenDoor(D1)
6. GoThrough(D1)
7. ApproachDoor(D9)
8. OpenDoor(D9)
9. GoThrough(D9)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan will efficiently guide you from the PORCHE to the GARAGE using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
