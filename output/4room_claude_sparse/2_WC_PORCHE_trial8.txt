Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the WC to the PORCHE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects PORCHE and SEJOUR
2. D2: Connects CELLIER and SEJOUR
3. D3: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
4. D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
5. D5: Connects CH.1 and DEGT
6. D6: Connects CH.2 and DEGT
7. D7: Connects BAINS and DEGT
8. D8: Connects WC and DEGT

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in WC
2. Use D8 to enter DEGT
3. Use D4 to enter SEJOUR
4. Use D1 to reach PORCHE

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the WC to the PORCHE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
