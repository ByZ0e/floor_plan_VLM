Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and their door connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan from the GARAGE to the WC.

Room and Door Connections:
1. GARAGE: D9 connects to CELLIER
2. CELLIER: D9 connects to GARAGE, D1 connects to HALL
3. HALL: D1 connects to CELLIER, D2 connects to BAINS, D3 connects to WC, D4 connects to CHAMBRE 1, D5 connects to CHAMBRE 2, D6 connects to PORCHE
4. BAINS: D2 connects to HALL
5. WC: D3 connects to HALL
6. CHAMBRE 1: D4 connects to HALL
7. CHAMBRE 2: D5 connects to HALL
8. PORCHE: D6 connects to HALL, D7 connects to CUISINE
9. CUISINE: D7 connects to PORCHE, D8 connects to TERRASSE COUVERTE
10. TERRASSE COUVERTE: D8 connects to CUISINE

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in GARAGE
2. ApproachDoor(D9)
3. OpenDoor(D9)
4. GoThrough(D9) - Now in CELLIER
5. ApproachDoor(D1)
6. OpenDoor(D1)
7. GoThrough(D1) - Now in HALL
8. ApproachDoor(D3)
9. OpenDoor(D3)
10. GoThrough(D3) - Now in WC (destination reached)

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from the GARAGE to the WC, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
