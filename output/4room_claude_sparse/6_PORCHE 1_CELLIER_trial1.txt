Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll first list out the relevant room and door connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from PORCHE1 to CELLIER 1.

Relevant Room and Door Connections:
- PORCHE1 connects to GARAGE1 through D21
- PORCHE1 connects to CELLIER1 through D31

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
1. Start in PORCHE1
2. Approach door D31
3. Open door D31
4. Go through door D31 to enter CELLIER1

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D31"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D31"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D31"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from PORCHE1 to CELLIER1 using only the necessary doors. The robot will start in PORCHE1, approach door D31, open it, and go through to reach CELLIER1, completing the navigation task.
