Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from CUISINE to CH.2.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects Porche and Sejour
- D2: Connects Cellier and Sejour
- D3: Connects Cuisine and Sejour
- D4: Connects Sejour and Degt
- D5: Connects Degt and CH.1
- D6: Connects Degt and CH.2
- D7: Connects Degt and Bains
- D8: Connects Degt and WC

Step-by-step navigation plan from CUISINE to CH.2:

1. Start in CUISINE
2. Use D3 to enter SEJOUR
3. Cross SEJOUR to reach D4
4. Use D4 to enter DEGT
5. From DEGT, use D6 to reach CH.2

Now, I'll provide the action sequence in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from CUISINE to CH.2, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
