Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from CH.1 to CUISINE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CH.1 connects to SEJOUR through D5
2. SEJOUR connects to DEGT through D4
3. SEJOUR connects to CUISINE through D3
4. DEGT connects to CH.2 through D6
5. DEGT connects to WC through D8
6. DEGT connects to BAINS through D7
7. PORCHE connects to SEJOUR through D1
8. CELLIER connects to CUISINE through D2

Step-by-step navigation plan from CH.1 to CUISINE:
1. Start in CH.1
2. ApproachDoor(D5)
3. OpenDoor(D5)
4. GoThrough(D5) to enter SEJOUR
5. ApproachDoor(D3)
6. OpenDoor(D3)
7. GoThrough(D3) to enter CUISINE

Now, I'll provide the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CH.1",
  "end": "CUISINE",
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(D5)",
    "OpenDoor(D5)",
    "GoThrough(D5)",
    "ApproachDoor(D3)",
    "OpenDoor(D3)",
    "GoThrough(D3)"
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan provides the most efficient route from CH.1 to CUISINE using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
