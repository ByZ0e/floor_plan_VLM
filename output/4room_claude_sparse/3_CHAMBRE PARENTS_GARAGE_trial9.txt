Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the CHAMBRE PARENTS to the GARAGE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D8 connects CHAMBRE PARENTS and HALL
2. D7 connects BAINS and HALL
3. D6 connects BUREAU and HALL
4. D5 connects LINGERIE and HALL
5. D4 connects WC and PORCHE
6. D3 connects PORCHE and CELLIER
7. D2 connects CELLIER and GARAGE
8. D1 connects GARAGE and CELLIER
9. D9 connects CHAMBRE ENFANT 2 and HALL
10. D10 connects CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 and HALL
11. D11 connects CELLIER and HALL

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in CHAMBRE PARENTS
2. Use D8 to enter HALL
3. Cross HALL to reach D11
4. Use D11 to enter CELLIER
5. Use D2 to enter GARAGE

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 11},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from CHAMBRE PARENTS to GARAGE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
