Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from PORCHE to BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
1. PORCHE - D1 - SEJOUR
2. SEJOUR - D2 - CUISINE
3. SEJOUR - D4 - DEGT
4. CUISINE - D3 - CELLIER
5. DEGT - D5 - CH.1
6. DEGT - D6 - CH.2
7. DEGT - D7 - BAINS
8. DEGT - D8 - WC

Navigation Plan:
To go from PORCHE to BAINS, we need to follow this path: PORCHE -> SEJOUR -> DEGT -> BAINS

Here's the detailed step-by-step plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from PORCHE to BAINS using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
