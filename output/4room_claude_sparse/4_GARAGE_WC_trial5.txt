Certainly! I'll analyze the floor plan, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the GARAGE to the WC.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D9: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER
2. D1: Connects CELLIER and HALL
3. D2: Connects HALL and BAINS
4. D3: Connects HALL and WC
5. D4: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 1
6. D5: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 2
7. D6: Connects HALL and PORCHE
8. D7: Connects PORCHE and CUISINE
9. D8: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
10. D10: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE and exterior (not relevant for this path)

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in GARAGE
2. ApproachDoor(9)
3. OpenDoor(9)
4. GoThrough(9) to enter CELLIER
5. ApproachDoor(1)
6. OpenDoor(1)
7. GoThrough(1) to enter HALL
8. ApproachDoor(3)
9. OpenDoor(3)
10. GoThrough(3) to enter WC

JSON format of the final path:
```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 9},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan provides the most efficient route from the GARAGE to the WC, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
