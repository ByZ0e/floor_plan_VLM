Certainly! I'll analyze the floor plan, list the room and door connections, and then provide a detailed navigation plan to get from the LINGERIE to the GARAGE.

Explicit Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER
- D2: Connects CELLIER and PORCHE
- D3: Connects PORCHE and LINGERIE
- D4: Connects LINGERIE and WC
- D5: Connects LINGERIE and BUREAU
- D6: Connects BUREAU and BAINS
- D7: Connects BAINS and CHAMBRE PARENTS
- D8: Connects CHAMBRE PARENTS and CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
- D9: Connects CHAMBRE ENFANT 2 and HALL
- D10: Connects CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 and HALL
- D11: Connects CELLIER and HALL

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in LINGERIE
2. ApproachDoor(D3)
3. OpenDoor(D3)
4. GoThrough(D3) to enter PORCHE
5. ApproachDoor(D2)
6. OpenDoor(D2)
7. GoThrough(D2) to enter CELLIER
8. ApproachDoor(D1)
9. OpenDoor(D1)
10. GoThrough(D1) to reach GARAGE

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "LINGERIE",
  "end": "GARAGE",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the LINGERIE to the GARAGE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
