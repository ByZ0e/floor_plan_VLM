Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from DEGT to CELLIER.

Room and Door Connections:
1. DEGT: Connected to SEJOUR via D5, to CH.1 via D6, to WC via D8
2. SEJOUR: Connected to DEGT via D5, to CUISINE via D3, to Porche via D1
3. CUISINE: Connected to SEJOUR via D3, to CELLIER via D2
4. CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE via D2, to Porche via D10
5. Porche: Connected to SEJOUR via D1, to CELLIER via D10
6. CH.1: Connected to DEGT via D6
7. CH.2: Connected to CH.1 via D4, to BAINS via D7
8. BAINS: Connected to CH.2 via D7, to WC via D9
9. WC: Connected to DEGT via D8, to BAINS via D9

Navigation Plan:
1. ApproachDoor(D5)
2. OpenDoor(D5)
3. GoThrough(D5)
4. ApproachDoor(D3)
5. OpenDoor(D3)
6. GoThrough(D3)
7. ApproachDoor(D2)
8. OpenDoor(D2)
9. GoThrough(D2)

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the DEGT to the CELLIER using only the necessary doors and rooms.
