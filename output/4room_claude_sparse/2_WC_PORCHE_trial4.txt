Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. Let's start by explicitly listing the rooms and doors with their connections based on the image:

Room and Door Connections:
1. WC: Connected to DEGT via D8
2. DEGT: Connected to WC via D8, SEJOUR via D4, CH.1 via D6
3. SEJOUR: Connected to DEGT via D4, CUISINE via D3, PORCHE via D1
4. CUISINE: Connected to SEJOUR via D3, CELLIER via D2
5. CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE via D2
6. PORCHE: Connected to SEJOUR via D1
7. CH.1: Connected to DEGT via D6
8. CH.2: Connected to DEGT via D7
9. BAINS: Connected to DEGT via D5

Now, let's create a step-by-step navigation plan to get from the WC to the PORCHE:

1. ApproachDoor(D8)
2. OpenDoor(D8)
3. GoThrough(D8)
4. ApproachDoor(D4)
5. OpenDoor(D4)
6. GoThrough(D4)
7. ApproachDoor(D1)
8. OpenDoor(D1)
9. GoThrough(D1)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan will efficiently guide you from the WC to the PORCHE using only the necessary doors and rooms along the path.
