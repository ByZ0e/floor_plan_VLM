Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from DEGT 1 to DEGT.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D51 connects DEGT 1 and SEJOUR 1
2. D41 connects SEJOUR 1 and CH.3
3. D9 connects CH.3 and CH.2
4. D6 connects CH.2 and DEGT
5. D5 connects DEGT and SEJOUR

Navigation Plan:

To go from DEGT 1 to DEGT, we need to follow this path: DEGT 1 -> SEJOUR 1 -> CH.3 -> CH.2 -> DEGT

Here's the step-by-step navigation plan:

1. ApproachDoor(D51)
2. OpenDoor(D51)
3. GoThrough(D51)
4. ApproachDoor(D41)
5. OpenDoor(D41)
6. GoThrough(D41)
7. ApproachDoor(D9)
8. OpenDoor(D9)
9. GoThrough(D9)
10. ApproachDoor(D6)
11. OpenDoor(D6)
12. GoThrough(D6)

Now, I'll provide the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D51"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D51"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D51"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D41"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D41"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D41"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan will efficiently guide you from DEGT 1 to DEGT using only the necessary doors and rooms.
