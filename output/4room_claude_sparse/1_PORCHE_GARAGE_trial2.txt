Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the PORCHE to the GARAGE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D6: Connects PORCHE and HALL
2. D5: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 2
3. D7: Connects HALL and CUISINE
4. D8: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
5. D4: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 1
3. D3: Connects HALL and WC
2. D2: Connects HALL and BAINS
1. D1: Connects HALL and CELLIER
9. D9: Connects CELLIER and GARAGE

Navigation Plan:
To go from the PORCHE to the GARAGE, we need to follow these steps:

1. ApproachDoor(D6)
2. OpenDoor(D6)
3. GoThrough(D6)
4. ApproachDoor(D1)
5. OpenDoor(D1)
6. GoThrough(D1)
7. ApproachDoor(D9)
8. OpenDoor(D9)
9. GoThrough(D9)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"}
  ]
}
```

This path takes you from the PORCHE through the HALL and CELLIER to reach the GARAGE, using only the necessary doors along the way.
