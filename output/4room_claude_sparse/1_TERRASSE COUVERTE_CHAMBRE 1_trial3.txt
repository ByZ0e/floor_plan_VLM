Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the connections and provide a navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
- D8: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE and CUISINE
- D7: Connects CUISINE and HALL
- D6: Connects PORCHE and HALL
- D5: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 2
- D4: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 1
- D3: Connects HALL and WC
- D2: Connects WC and BAINS
- D1: Connects HALL and CELLIER
- D9: Connects CELLIER and GARAGE

Step-by-step navigation plan from TERRASSE COUVERTE to CHAMBRE 1:
1. Start in TERRASSE COUVERTE
2. Use D8 to enter CUISINE
3. Use D7 to enter HALL
4. Use D4 to enter CHAMBRE 1

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from TERRASSE COUVERTE to CHAMBRE 1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
