Thank you for providing the floor plan image. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the PORCHE to BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
1. PORCHE: D1
2. SEJOUR: D1, D2, D3, D4, D5
3. CUISINE: D2, D3, D8
4. CELLIER: D2, D10
5. CH.1: D5, D6
6. DEGT: D4, D5, D6, D7, D8
7. BAINS: D7
8. CH.2: D6, D9

Navigation Plan:

To get from PORCHE to BAINS, we need to follow this path: PORCHE -> SEJOUR -> DEGT -> BAINS

Here's the detailed action plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from PORCHE to BAINS using only the necessary doors. The robot will start in PORCHE, go through SEJOUR, then DEGT, and finally reach BAINS.
