Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from CUISINE 1 to CELLIER.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D31 connects CUISINE1 and SEJOUR1
2. D21 connects CELLIER1 and Porche1
3. D11 connects Porche1 and SEJOUR1
4. D10 connects CELLIER and Porche
5. D2 connects Porche and CUISINE
6. D3 connects CUISINE and SEJOUR

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in CUISINE1
2. Use D31 to enter SEJOUR1
3. Use D11 to enter Porche1
4. Use D21 to enter CELLIER1
5. Use D10 to enter CELLIER (destination)

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D31"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D31"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D31"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D21"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D21"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D21"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D10"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides an efficient route from CUISINE1 to CELLIER, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
