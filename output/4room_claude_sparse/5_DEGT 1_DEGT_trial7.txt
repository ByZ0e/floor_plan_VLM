Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms, doors, and their connections, then provide a navigation plan from DEGT 1 to DEGT.

Room and Door Connections:
1. DEGT 1 connects to CH.3 via D51
2. CH.3 connects to SEJOUR1 via D41
3. SEJOUR1 connects to CUISINE via D3
4. CUISINE connects to DEGT via D8

Navigation Plan:

1. ApproachDoor(D51)
2. OpenDoor(D51)
3. GoThrough(D51)
4. ApproachDoor(D41)
5. OpenDoor(D41)
6. GoThrough(D41)
7. ApproachDoor(D3)
8. OpenDoor(D3)
9. GoThrough(D3)
10. ApproachDoor(D8)
11. OpenDoor(D8)
12. GoThrough(D8)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D51"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D51"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D51"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D41"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D41"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D41"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from DEGT 1 to DEGT, using only the necessary doors along the path.
