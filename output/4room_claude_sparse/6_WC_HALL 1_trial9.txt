Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the connections and create a navigation plan for you to move from the WC to HALL 1. Let's start by listing the relevant rooms and doors:

Room and Door Connections:
1. WC connects to LINGERIE via D4
2. LINGERIE connects to HALL via D5
3. HALL connects to CELLIER via D11

Now, let's create the step-by-step navigation plan:

1. Start in WC
2. ApproachDoor(D4)
3. OpenDoor(D4)
4. GoThrough(D4) to enter LINGERIE
5. ApproachDoor(D5)
6. OpenDoor(D5)
7. GoThrough(D5) to enter HALL
8. We have now reached HALL 1 (our destination)

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the WC to HALL 1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
