Thank you for providing this detailed floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, create a list of room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from CELLIER 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE 1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CELLIER 1 - D91 - GARAGE 1
2. CELLIER 1 - D11 - BAINS 1
3. BAINS 1 - D21 - WC 1
4. BAINS 1 - D31 - CHAMBRE 4
5. CHAMBRE 4 - D41 - HALL 1
6. HALL 1 - D51 - CHAMBRE 3
7. HALL 1 - D61 - PORCHE 1
8. PORCHE 1 - D71 - CUISINE 1
9. CUISINE 1 - D81 - TERRASSE COUVERTE 1

Navigation Plan:
To get from CELLIER 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE 1, we need to follow this path:
CELLIER 1 -> BAINS 1 -> CHAMBRE 4 -> HALL 1 -> PORCHE 1 -> CUISINE 1 -> TERRASSE COUVERTE 1

Here's the detailed plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D31"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D31"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D31"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D41"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D41"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D41"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D71"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D71"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D71"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D81"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D81"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D81"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from CELLIER 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE 1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
