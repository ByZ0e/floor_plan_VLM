Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from PORCHE to BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
1. PORCHE connects to SEJOUR via D1
2. SEJOUR connects to CUISINE via D3
3. CUISINE connects to CELLIER via D2
4. CUISINE connects to WC via D8
5. CUISINE connects to BAINS via D7
6. SEJOUR connects to CH.1 via D5
7. SEJOUR connects to DEGT via D4
8. DEGT connects to CH.2 via D6
9. CH.2 connects to CH.4 via D9

Navigation Plan from PORCHE to BAINS:
1. ApproachDoor(D1)
2. OpenDoor(D1)
3. GoThrough(D1)
4. ApproachDoor(D3)
5. OpenDoor(D3)
6. GoThrough(D3)
7. ApproachDoor(D7)
8. OpenDoor(D7)
9. GoThrough(D7)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"}
  ]
}
```

This path takes you from PORCHE through SEJOUR and CUISINE to reach BAINS, using only the necessary doors along the way.
