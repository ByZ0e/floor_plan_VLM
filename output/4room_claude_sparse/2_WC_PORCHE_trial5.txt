Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. Let me first list out the rooms and doors with their connections based on the image:

Rooms and Door Connections:
1. WC connects to DEGT through D8
2. DEGT connects to SEJOUR through D4
3. DEGT connects to CH.1 through D6
4. DEGT connects to CUISINE through D7
5. SEJOUR connects to CUISINE through D3
6. SEJOUR connects to PORCHE through D1
7. CUISINE connects to CELLIER through D2

Now, let's create a step-by-step navigation plan to go from WC to PORCHE:

1. Start in WC
2. Use D8 to go from WC to DEGT
3. Use D4 to go from DEGT to SEJOUR
4. Use D1 to go from SEJOUR to PORCHE

Based on these steps, here's the detailed action plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D8"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D8"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D8"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D1"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from WC to PORCHE using only the necessary doors. The robot will start in WC, move through DEGT and SEJOUR, and finally reach PORCHE.
