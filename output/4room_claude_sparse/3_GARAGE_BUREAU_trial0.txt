Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the GARAGE to the BUREAU.

Room and Door Connections:
- GARAGE: connected to CELLIER via D1
- CELLIER: connected to GARAGE via D1, to PORCHE via D2
- PORCHE: connected to CELLIER via D2, to WC via D3
- WC: connected to PORCHE via D3, to LINGERIE via D4
- LINGERIE: connected to WC via D4, to BUREAU via D5
- BUREAU: connected to LINGERIE via D5

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
1. Start in GARAGE
2. Use D1 to enter CELLIER
3. Use D2 to enter PORCHE
4. Use D3 to enter WC
5. Use D4 to enter LINGERIE
6. Use D5 to enter BUREAU

Now, I'll provide the detailed navigation plan in the requested format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the GARAGE to the BUREAU using only the necessary doors along the path.
