Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from DEGT to CELLIER.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects Porche and SEJOUR
2. D2 connects SEJOUR and CELLIER
3. D3 connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
4. D4 connects SEJOUR and DEGT
5. D5 connects DEGT and CH.1
6. D6 connects DEGT and CH.2
7. D7 connects DEGT and BAINS
8. D8 connects DEGT and WC

Navigation Plan:
To get from DEGT to CELLIER, we need to go through SEJOUR. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(D4)
2. OpenDoor(D4)
3. GoThrough(D4)
4. ApproachDoor(D2)
5. OpenDoor(D2)
6. GoThrough(D2)

Now, let's present this in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "DEGT",
  "end": "CELLIER",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from DEGT to CELLIER using only the necessary doors. The robot will start in DEGT, move through SEJOUR, and finally arrive at CELLIER.
