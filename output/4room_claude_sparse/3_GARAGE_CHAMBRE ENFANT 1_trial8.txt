Certainly! I'll provide a detailed analysis of the floor plan, list the room and door connections, and then create an efficient navigation plan for you to move from the GARAGE to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER
D2: Connects CELLIER to PORCHE
D3: Connects PORCHE to LINGERIE
D4: Connects LINGERIE to WC
D5: Connects LINGERIE to BUREAU
D6: Connects BUREAU to BAINS
D7: Connects BAINS to CHAMBRE PARENTS
D8: Connects CHAMBRE PARENTS to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
D9: Connects CHAMBRE ENFANT 2 to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
D10: Connects CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 to HALL
D11: Connects CELLIER to HALL

Step-by-step navigation plan:

1. Start in the GARAGE
2. Use D1 to enter CELLIER
3. Use D11 to enter HALL
4. Use D10 to enter CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 (destination)

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 11},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 10}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the GARAGE to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
