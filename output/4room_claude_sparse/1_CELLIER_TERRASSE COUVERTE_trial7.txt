Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the CELLIER to the TERRASSE COUVERTE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects CELLIER and HALL
2. D2: Connects HALL and WC
3. D3: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 1
4. D4: Connects HALL and BAINS
5. D5: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 2
6. D6: Connects HALL and PORCHE
7. D7: Connects PORCHE and CUISINE
8. D8: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
9. D9: Connects CELLIER and GARAGE

Navigation Plan:
To go from the CELLIER to the TERRASSE COUVERTE, we need to use the following path: CELLIER -> HALL -> PORCHE -> CUISINE -> TERRASSE COUVERTE.

Here's the step-by-step navigation plan:

1. ApproachDoor(D1)
2. OpenDoor(D1)
3. GoThrough(D1)
4. ApproachDoor(D6)
5. OpenDoor(D6)
6. GoThrough(D6)
7. ApproachDoor(D7)
8. OpenDoor(D7)
9. GoThrough(D7)
10. ApproachDoor(D8)
11. OpenDoor(D8)
12. GoThrough(D8)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the CELLIER to the TERRASSE COUVERTE using only the necessary doors and rooms.
