Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. Let me start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections based on the image:

Rooms and Door Connections:
1. Porche: connected to Sejour via D1
2. Cellier: connected to Cuisine via D2
3. Sejour: connected to Porche via D1, to Cuisine via D3, to CH.1 via D4
4. Cuisine: connected to Cellier via D2, to Sejour via D3, to Degt via D8
5. CH.1: connected to Sejour via D4, to Degt via D5
6. Degt: connected to CH.1 via D5, to CH.2 via D6, to Bains via D7, to Cuisine via D8
7. CH.2: connected to Degt via D6
8. Bains: connected to Degt via D7

Now, I'll provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from the Porche to the Bains:

1. ApproachDoor(D1)
2. OpenDoor(D1)
3. GoThrough(D1)
4. ApproachDoor(D3)
5. OpenDoor(D3)
6. GoThrough(D3)
7. ApproachDoor(D8)
8. OpenDoor(D8)
9. GoThrough(D8)
10. ApproachDoor(D7)
11. OpenDoor(D7)
12. GoThrough(D7)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"}
  ]
}
```

This path takes you from the Porche through the Sejour, then to the Cuisine, through the Degt, and finally to the Bains. It uses the minimum number of doors necessary to reach the destination efficiently.
