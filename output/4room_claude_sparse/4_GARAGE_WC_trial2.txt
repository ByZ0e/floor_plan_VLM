Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the GARAGE to the WC.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D9: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER
2. D1: Connects CELLIER and HALL
3. D2: Connects HALL and BAINS
4. D3: Connects HALL and WC

Step-by-step Solution:
1. Start in GARAGE
2. Use D9 to enter CELLIER
3. Use D1 to enter HALL
4. Use D3 to enter WC

Final Navigation Plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the GARAGE to the WC, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
