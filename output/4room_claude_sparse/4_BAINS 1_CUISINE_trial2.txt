Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
1. BAINS 1 - D21 - HALL1
2. HALL1 - D41 - CHAMBRE 4
3. HALL1 - D51 - CHAMBRE 3
4. HALL1 - D61 - PORCHE 1
5. PORCHE 1 - D71 - CUISINE 1

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
1. Start in BAINS 1
2. Use D21 to enter HALL1
3. Use D61 to enter PORCHE 1
4. Use D71 to enter CUISINE 1 (destination)

Now, I'll provide the detailed navigation plan in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D21"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D21"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D21"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D71"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D71"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D71"}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan provides the most efficient path from BAINS 1 to CUISINE 1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
