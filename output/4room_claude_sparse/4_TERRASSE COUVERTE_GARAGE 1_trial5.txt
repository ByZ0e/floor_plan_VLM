Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a detailed navigation plan from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to GARAGE 1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D8: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE and CUISINE
2. D7: Connects CUISINE and PORCHE
3. D6: Connects PORCHE and HALL
4. D9: Connects HALL and GARAGE
5. D10: Connects HALL and HALL1
6. D61: Connects HALL1 and PORCHE1
7. D71: Connects PORCHE1 and CUISINE1
8. D81: Connects CUISINE1 and TERRASSE COUVERTE 1
9. D91: Connects HALL1 and GARAGE1

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in TERRASSE COUVERTE
2. Use D8 to enter CUISINE
3. Use D7 to enter PORCHE
4. Use D6 to enter HALL
5. Use D10 to enter HALL1
6. Use D91 to reach GARAGE1

Now, I'll provide the detailed navigation plan in the requested format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D91"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D91"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D91"}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan provides the most efficient path from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to GARAGE 1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
