Certainly! I'll analyze the floor plan, list the room and door connections, and then provide a detailed navigation plan from the GARAGE to the WC.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER
2. D2: Connects CELLIER to PORCHE
3. D3: Connects PORCHE to LINGERIE
4. D4: Connects LINGERIE to WC
5. D5: Connects LINGERIE to BUREAU
6. D6: Connects BUREAU to BAINS
7. D7: Connects BAINS to CHAMBRE PARENTS
8. D8: Connects CHAMBRE PARENTS to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
9. D9: Connects CHAMBRE ENFANT 2 to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
10. D10: Connects CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 to HALL
11. D11: Connects CELLIER to HALL

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in GARAGE
2. Use D1 to enter CELLIER
3. Use D2 to enter PORCHE
4. Use D3 to enter LINGERIE
5. Use D4 to reach WC

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan provides the most efficient route from the GARAGE to the WC, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
