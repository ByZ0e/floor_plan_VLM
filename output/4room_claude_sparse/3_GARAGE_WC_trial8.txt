Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the GARAGE to the WC.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:
- D1: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER
- D2: Connects CELLIER to PORCHE
- D3: Connects PORCHE to LINGERIE
- D4: Connects LINGERIE to WC
- D5: Connects LINGERIE to BUREAU
- D6: Connects BUREAU to BAINS
- D7: Connects BAINS to CHAMBRE PARENTS
- D8: Connects CHAMBRE PARENTS to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
- D9: Connects CHAMBRE ENFANT 2 to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
- D10: Connects CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 to HALL
- D11: Connects CELLIER to HALL

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in GARAGE
2. ApproachDoor(1)
3. OpenDoor(1)
4. GoThrough(1) to enter CELLIER
5. ApproachDoor(2)
6. OpenDoor(2)
7. GoThrough(2) to enter PORCHE
8. ApproachDoor(3)
9. OpenDoor(3)
10. GoThrough(3) to enter LINGERIE
11. ApproachDoor(4)
12. OpenDoor(4)
13. GoThrough(4) to enter WC (destination reached)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(1)",
    "OpenDoor(1)",
    "GoThrough(1)",
    "ApproachDoor(2)",
    "OpenDoor(2)",
    "GoThrough(2)",
    "ApproachDoor(3)",
    "OpenDoor(3)",
    "GoThrough(3)",
    "ApproachDoor(4)",
    "OpenDoor(4)",
    "GoThrough(4)"
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan provides the most efficient route from the GARAGE to the WC, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
