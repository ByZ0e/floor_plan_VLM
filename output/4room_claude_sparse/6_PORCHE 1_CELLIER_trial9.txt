Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from PORCHE 1 to CELLIER 1.

Room and Door Connections:
- PORCHE 1 connects to GARAGE 1 via D21
- PORCHE 1 connects to CELLIER 1 via D31
- CELLIER 1 connects to GARAGE 1 via D13
- CELLIER 1 connects to HALL 1 via D111

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in PORCHE 1
2. Use D31 to go from PORCHE 1 to CELLIER 1

Based on this analysis, here's the efficient navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 31},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 31},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 31}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from PORCHE 1 to CELLIER 1 using the most direct route available based on the floor plan provided.
