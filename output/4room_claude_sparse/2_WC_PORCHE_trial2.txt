Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the WC to the Porche.

Room and Door Connections:
1. WC: connected to DEGT via D8
2. DEGT: connected to WC via D8, SEJOUR via D4, CH.1 via D6
3. SEJOUR: connected to DEGT via D4, CUISINE via D3, PORCHE via D1
4. CUISINE: connected to SEJOUR via D3
5. PORCHE: connected to SEJOUR via D1
6. CH.1: connected to DEGT via D6
7. CH.2: not directly connected to any other room through visible doors
8. BAINS: not directly connected to any other room through visible doors
9. CELLIER: connected to PORCHE via D2 (though not needed for this route)

Navigation Plan:
Starting from the WC, we need to go through DEGT and SEJOUR to reach the PORCHE. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(D8)
2. OpenDoor(D8)
3. GoThrough(D8)
4. ApproachDoor(D4)
5. OpenDoor(D4)
6. GoThrough(D4)
7. ApproachDoor(D1)
8. OpenDoor(D1)
9. GoThrough(D1)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the WC to the PORCHE using only the necessary doors and rooms.
