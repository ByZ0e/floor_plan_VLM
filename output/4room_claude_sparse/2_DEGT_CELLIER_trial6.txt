Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and their door connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from DEGT to CELLIER.

1. DEGT: Connected to SEJOUR via D4, CH.1 via D5, and WC via D8
2. SEJOUR: Connected to DEGT via D4, CUISINE via D3, and PORCHE via D1
3. CUISINE: Connected to SEJOUR via D3 and CELLIER via D2
4. CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE via D2

6. CH.1: Connected to DEGT via D5
7. WC: Connected to DEGT via D8
8. BAINS: Connected to DEGT via D7
9. CH.2: No direct door connection visible

Navigation Plan:
To go from DEGT to CELLIER, we need to follow this path: DEGT -> SEJOUR -> CUISINE -> CELLIER

Here's the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D3"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D3"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D3"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D2"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D2"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D2"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from DEGT to CELLIER using only the necessary doors and rooms.
