Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the connections and provide a navigation plan as requested.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER
D2: Connects CELLIER and PORCHE
D3: Connects PORCHE and LINGERIE
D4: Connects LINGERIE and WC
D5: Connects WC and BUREAU
D6: Connects BUREAU and BAINS
D7: Connects BAINS and CHAMBRE PARENTS
D8: Connects CHAMBRE PARENTS and HALL
D9: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
D10: Connects CHAMBRE ENFANT 2 and CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
D11: Connects CELLIER and HALL
D12: Connects the two sections of the HALL

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in LINGERIE
2. Go through D3 to enter PORCHE
3. Go through D2 to enter CELLIER
4. Go through D1 to enter GARAGE

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from LINGERIE to GARAGE using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
