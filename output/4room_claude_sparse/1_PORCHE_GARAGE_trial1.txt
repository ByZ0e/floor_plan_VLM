Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan from the PORCHE to the GARAGE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D6: Connects PORCHE and HALL
2. D5: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 2
3. D7: Connects HALL and CUISINE
4. D8: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
5. D4: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 1
3. D3: Connects HALL and WC
2. D2: Connects WC and BAINS
1. D1: Connects HALL and CELLIER
9. D9: Connects CELLIER and GARAGE

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in PORCHE
2. ApproachDoor(D6)
3. OpenDoor(D6)
4. GoThrough(D6) to enter HALL
5. ApproachDoor(D1)
6. OpenDoor(D1)
7. GoThrough(D1) to enter CELLIER
8. ApproachDoor(D9)
9. OpenDoor(D9)
10. GoThrough(D9) to enter GARAGE

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan provides the most efficient route from the PORCHE to the GARAGE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
