Certainly! I'll analyze the floor plan, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide you with a detailed navigation plan from the GARAGE to the BUREAU.

Room and Door Connections:
1. GARAGE - D1 - CELLIER
2. CELLIER - D2 - PORCHE
3. PORCHE - D3 - LINGERIE
4. LINGERIE - D5 - BUREAU
5. CELLIER - D11 - HALL

Navigation Plan:

To navigate from the GARAGE to the BUREAU, we need to go through the following rooms: GARAGE -> CELLIER -> PORCHE -> LINGERIE -> BUREAU.

Here's the step-by-step navigation plan:

1. ApproachDoor(1)
2. OpenDoor(1)
3. GoThrough(1)
4. ApproachDoor(2)
5. OpenDoor(2)
6. GoThrough(2)
7. ApproachDoor(3)
8. OpenDoor(3)
9. GoThrough(3)
10. ApproachDoor(5)
11. OpenDoor(5)
12. GoThrough(5)

Now, I'll provide the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan will efficiently guide you from the GARAGE to the BUREAU using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
