Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the CELLIER to the TERRASSE COUVERTE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CELLIER: Connected to GARAGE via D9, to HALL via D1
2. GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER via D9
3. HALL: Connected to CELLIER via D1, to BAINS/WC via D2, to CHAMBRE 1 via D3, to CHAMBRE 2 via D5, to PORCHE via D6
4. BAINS/WC: Connected to HALL via D2
5. CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D3
6. CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL via D5
7. PORCHE: Connected to HALL via D6, to CUISINE via D7
8. CUISINE: Connected to PORCHE via D7, to TERRASSE COUVERTE via D8
9. TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE via D8

Navigation Plan:
1. ApproachDoor(D1)
2. OpenDoor(D1)
3. GoThrough(D1)
4. ApproachDoor(D6)
5. OpenDoor(D6)
6. GoThrough(D6)
7. ApproachDoor(D7)
8. OpenDoor(D7)
9. GoThrough(D7)
10. ApproachDoor(D8)
11. OpenDoor(D8)
12. GoThrough(D8)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan will efficiently guide you from the CELLIER to the TERRASSE COUVERTE using only the necessary doors and rooms.
