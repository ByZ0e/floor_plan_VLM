Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan to get from the GARAGE to the WC.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D9: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER
2. D1: Connects CELLIER and HALL
3. D2: Connects HALL and BAINS
4. D3: Connects BAINS and WC
5. D4: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 1
6. D5: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 2
7. D6: Connects HALL and PORCHE
8. D7: Connects PORCHE and CUISINE
9. D8: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE

Navigation Plan:
To get from the GARAGE to the WC, we need to go through the following doors: D9, D1, D2, and D3.

Here's the step-by-step navigation plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 9},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the GARAGE to the WC using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
