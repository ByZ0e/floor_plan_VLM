Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the BAINS to the GARAGE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects CELLIER and HALL
2. D2: Connects BAINS and HALL
3. D3: Connects WC and HALL
4. D4: Connects CHAMBRE 1 and HALL
5. D5: Connects CHAMBRE 2 and HALL
6. D6: Connects PORCHE and HALL
7. D7: Connects CUISINE and HALL
8. D8: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
9. D9: Connects CELLIER and GARAGE

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in BAINS
2. ApproachDoor(D2)
3. OpenDoor(D2)
4. GoThrough(D2) to enter HALL
5. ApproachDoor(D1)
6. OpenDoor(D1)
7. GoThrough(D1) to enter CELLIER
8. ApproachDoor(D9)
9. OpenDoor(D9)
10. GoThrough(D9) to enter GARAGE

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "BAINS",
  "end": "GARAGE",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the BAINS to the GARAGE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
