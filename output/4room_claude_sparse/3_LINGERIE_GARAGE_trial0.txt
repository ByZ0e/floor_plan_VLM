Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the LINGERIE to the GARAGE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER
2. D2: Connects CELLIER and PORCHE
3. D3: Connects PORCHE and LINGERIE
4. D4: Connects LINGERIE and WC (not needed for this route)
5. D5: Connects LINGERIE and BUREAU (not needed for this route)
6. D6: Connects BUREAU and BAINS (not needed for this route)
7. D7: Connects BAINS and CHAMBRE PARENTS (not needed for this route)
8. D8: Connects CHAMBRE PARENTS and CHAMBRE ENFANT 2 (not needed for this route)
9. D9: Connects CHAMBRE ENFANT 2 and CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 (not needed for this route)
10. D10: Connects CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 and HALL (not needed for this route)
11. D11: Connects CELLIER and HALL (not needed for this route)

Navigation Plan:
To go from LINGERIE to GARAGE, we need to use doors D3, D2, and D1 in that order. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. Start in LINGERIE
2. ApproachDoor(3)
3. OpenDoor(3)
4. GoThrough(3) // Now in PORCHE
5. ApproachDoor(2)
6. OpenDoor(2)
7. GoThrough(2) // Now in CELLIER
8. ApproachDoor(1)
9. OpenDoor(1)
10. GoThrough(1) // Now in GARAGE

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "LINGERIE",
  "end": "GARAGE",
  "steps": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from the LINGERIE to the GARAGE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
