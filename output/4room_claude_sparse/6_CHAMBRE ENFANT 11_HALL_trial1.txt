Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the connections and provide a navigation plan as requested.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D91: Connects CHAMBRE ENFANT 21 to HALL 1
D101: Connects CHAMBRE ENFANT 11 to HALL 1
D81: Connects CHAMBRE PARENTS1 to HALL 1
D71: Connects BAINS1 to HALL 1
D61: Connects BUREAU1 to HALL 1
D51: Connects LINGERIE1 to HALL 1
D41: Connects WC1 to HALL 1
D31: Connects PORCHE1 to CELLIER 1
D21: Connects PORCHE1 to GARAGE 1
D111: Connects CELLIER 1 to HALL 1
D13: Connects GARAGE 1 to CELLIER 1

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CHAMBRE ENFANT 11
2. Use door D101 to enter HALL 1

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CHAMBRE ENFANT 11",
  "end": "HALL 1",
  "plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D101"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D101"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D101"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from CHAMBRE ENFANT 11 to HALL 1, using only the necessary door (D101) to complete the navigation task.
