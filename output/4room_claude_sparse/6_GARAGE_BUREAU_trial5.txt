Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a detailed navigation plan for you to move from the GARAGE to the BUREAU.

Room and Door Connections:
1. GARAGE <-> D1 <-> CELLIER
2. CELLIER <-> D2 <-> PORCHE
3. PORCHE <-> D3 <-> WC
4. WC <-> D4 <-> LINGERIE
5. LINGERIE <-> D5 <-> BUREAU
6. BUREAU <-> D6 <-> BAINS
7. BAINS <-> D7 <-> CHAMBRE PARENTS
8. CHAMBRE PARENTS <-> D8 <-> HALL
9. HALL <-> D9 <-> CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
10. HALL <-> D10 <-> CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
11. CELLIER <-> D11 <-> HALL

Navigation Plan:
To go from the GARAGE to the BUREAU, we need to follow this path: GARAGE -> CELLIER -> HALL -> LINGERIE -> BUREAU

Here's the detailed step-by-step navigation plan:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 11},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the GARAGE to the BUREAU using the minimum number of necessary doors and rooms. The path avoids any unnecessary detours and ensures you reach your destination following the rules of the building's layout.
