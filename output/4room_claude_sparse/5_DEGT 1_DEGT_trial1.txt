Thank you for providing the floor plan image and the navigation task. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
- DEGT 1 connects to SEJOUR 1 through door D51
- SEJOUR 1 connects to CUISINE through door D3
- CUISINE connects to SEJOUR through door D3
- SEJOUR connects to DEGT through door D5

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
1. Start in DEGT 1
2. ApproachDoor(D51)
3. OpenDoor(D51)
4. GoThrough(D51) to enter SEJOUR 1
5. ApproachDoor(D3)
6. OpenDoor(D3)
7. GoThrough(D3) to enter CUISINE
8. ApproachDoor(D3)
9. OpenDoor(D3)
10. GoThrough(D3) to enter SEJOUR
11. ApproachDoor(D5)
12. OpenDoor(D5)
13. GoThrough(D5) to reach DEGT

Final Navigation Plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D51"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D51"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D51"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan will efficiently guide you from DEGT 1 to DEGT using only the necessary doors and rooms along the path.
