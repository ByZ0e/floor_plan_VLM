Thank you for providing the floor plan image. I'll first list out the rooms and their door connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan from BAINS 1 to CUISINE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. BAINS 1: Connected to HALL1 via D21
2. HALL1: Connected to BAINS 1 via D21, CHAMBRE 4 via D41, CHAMBRE 3 via D51, PORCHE 1 via D61
3. CHAMBRE 4: Connected to HALL1 via D41
4. CHAMBRE 3: Connected to HALL1 via D51
5. PORCHE 1: Connected to HALL1 via D61, CUISINE 1 via D71
6. CUISINE 1: Connected to PORCHE 1 via D71

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in BAINS 1
2. Use D21 to enter HALL1
3. Cross HALL1 to reach D61
4. Use D61 to enter PORCHE 1
5. Use D71 to enter CUISINE 1 (goal reached)

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D21"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D21"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D21"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D61"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D61"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D61"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D71"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D71"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D71"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from BAINS 1 to CUISINE 1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
