Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects Garage to Cellier
2. D2: Connects Cellier to Porche
3. D3: Connects Porche to Lingerie
4. D4: Connects Lingerie to WC
5. D5: Connects Lingerie to Bureau

7. D7: Connects Bains to Chambre Parents
8. D8: Connects Chambre Parents to Chambre Enfant 2
9. D9: Connects Chambre Enfant 2 to Chambre Enfant 1
10. D10: Connects Chambre Enfant 1 to Hall
11. D11: Connects Cellier to Hall

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in Garage
2. ApproachDoor(1)
3. OpenDoor(1)
4. GoThrough(1) to enter Cellier
5. ApproachDoor(11)
6. OpenDoor(11)
7. GoThrough(11) to enter Hall
8. ApproachDoor(10)
9. OpenDoor(10)
10. GoThrough(10) to reach Chambre Enfant 1

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 11},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 10}
  ]
}
```
