Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the CUISINE to CH.2.

Rooms and Doors:

1. Porche: Connected to Sejour via D1
2. Cellier: Connected to Cuisine via D2
3. Sejour: Connected to Porche via D1, to Cuisine via D3, to CH.1 via D4
4. Cuisine: Connected to Cellier via D2, to Sejour via D3, to Degt via D8
5. CH.1: Connected to Sejour via D4, to Degt via D5
6. CH.2: Connected to Degt via D6
7. Degt (Dégagement/Hallway): Connected to Cuisine via D8, to CH.1 via D5, to CH.2 via D6, to Bains via D7
8. Bains: Connected to Degt via D7
9. WC: Connected to Degt (no separate door, part of Degt)

Navigation Plan:

To go from CUISINE to CH.2, we need to follow these steps:

1. ApproachDoor(D8)
2. OpenDoor(D8)
3. GoThrough(D8)
4. ApproachDoor(D6)
5. OpenDoor(D6)
6. GoThrough(D6)

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CUISINE",
  "end": "CH.2",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"}
  ]
}
```

This plan takes you from the CUISINE through the Degt (hallway) and directly into CH.2, using only the necessary doors for the most efficient path.
