Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the PORCHE to the GARAGE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects CELLIER and HALL
2. D2: Connects BAINS and HALL
3. D3: Connects WC and HALL
4. D4: Connects CHAMBRE 1 and HALL
5. D5: Connects CHAMBRE 2 and HALL
6. D6: Connects PORCHE and HALL
7. D7: Connects CUISINE and HALL
8. D8: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
9. D9: Connects CELLIER and GARAGE

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in PORCHE
2. Use D6 to enter HALL
3. Use D1 to enter CELLIER
4. Use D9 to reach GARAGE

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "PORCHE",
  "end": "GARAGE",
  "plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D6"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D6"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D6"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D9"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D9"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D9"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the PORCHE to the GARAGE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
