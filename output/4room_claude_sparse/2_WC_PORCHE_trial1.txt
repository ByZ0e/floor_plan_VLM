Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a detailed navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
- WC: Connected to DEGT via D8
- DEGT: Connected to WC via D8, SEJOUR via D4, CH.1 via D6
- SEJOUR: Connected to DEGT via D4, CUISINE via D3, PORCHE via D1
- CUISINE: Connected to SEJOUR via D3, CELLIER via D2
- PORCHE: Connected to SEJOUR via D1
- CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE via D2
- CH.1: Connected to DEGT via D6
- CH.2: Connected to DEGT via D7
- BAINS: Connected to DEGT via D7

Now, I'll provide the step-by-step navigation plan to go from WC to PORCHE:

1. ApproachDoor(8)
2. OpenDoor(8)
3. GoThrough(8)
4. ApproachDoor(4)
5. OpenDoor(4)
6. GoThrough(4)
7. ApproachDoor(1)
8. OpenDoor(1)
9. GoThrough(1)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan will efficiently guide you from the WC to the PORCHE using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
