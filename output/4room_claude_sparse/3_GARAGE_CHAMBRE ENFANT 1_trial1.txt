Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the GARAGE to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER
2. D2: Connects CELLIER to PORCHE
3. D3: Connects PORCHE to LINGERIE
4. D4: Connects LINGERIE to WC
5. D5: Connects LINGERIE to BUREAU
6. D6: Connects BUREAU to BAINS
7. D7: Connects BAINS to CHAMBRE PARENTS
8. D8: Connects CHAMBRE PARENTS to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
9. D9: Connects CHAMBRE ENFANT 2 to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
10. D10: Connects CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 to HALL
11. D11: Connects CELLIER to HALL

Navigation Plan:
1. ApproachDoor(1)
2. OpenDoor(1)
3. GoThrough(1)
4. ApproachDoor(11)
5. OpenDoor(11)
6. GoThrough(11)
7. ApproachDoor(10)
8. OpenDoor(10)
9. GoThrough(10)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 11},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 10}
  ]
}
```

This path takes you from the GARAGE through the CELLIER and HALL to reach CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 efficiently, using only the necessary doors.
