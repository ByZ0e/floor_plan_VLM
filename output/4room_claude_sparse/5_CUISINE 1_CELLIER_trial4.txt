Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from CUISINE 1 to CELLIER.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D31 connects CUISINE1 and SEJOUR1
2. D21 connects CELLIER1 and PORCHE1
3. D11 connects PORCHE1 and SEJOUR1
4. D10 connects SEJOUR1 and CELLIER
5. D2 connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
6. D3 connects CUISINE and SEJOUR

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CUISINE1
2. Use D31 to go from CUISINE1 to SEJOUR1
3. Use D11 to go from SEJOUR1 to PORCHE1
4. Use D21 to go from PORCHE1 to CELLIER1
5. Use D10 to go from CELLIER1 to CELLIER (destination)

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D31"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D31"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D31"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D21"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D21"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D21"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D10"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from CUISINE1 to CELLIER, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
