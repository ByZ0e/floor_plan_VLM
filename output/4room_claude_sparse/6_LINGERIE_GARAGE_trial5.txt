Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the LINGERIE to the GARAGE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER
2. D2: Connects CELLIER and PORCHE
3. D3: Connects PORCHE and LINGERIE
4. D4: Connects LINGERIE and WC
5. D5: Connects WC and BUREAU
6. D6: Connects BUREAU and BAINS
7. D7: Connects BAINS and HALL
8. D8: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE PARENTS
9. D9: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
10. D10: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
11. D11: Connects CELLIER and HALL
12. D12: Connects the two sections of the HALL

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in LINGERIE
2. Go through D3 to enter PORCHE
3. Go through D2 to enter CELLIER
4. Go through D1 to enter GARAGE

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the LINGERIE to the GARAGE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
