Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from DEGT 1 to DEGT.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects Porche to SEJOUR
D2: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
D3: Connects CUISINE to SEJOUR
D4: Connects SEJOUR to DEGT
D5: Connects DEGT to CH.1
D6: Connects DEGT to CH.2
D7: Connects DEGT to BAINS
D8: Connects DEGT to WC
D9: Connects CH.2 to CH.4
D10: Connects CELLIER to CELLIER1
D11: Connects Porche1 to SEJOUR1
D21: Connects CELLIER1 to CUISINE1
D31: Connects CUISINE1 to SEJOUR1
D41: Connects SEJOUR1 to DEGT1
D51: Connects DEGT1 to CH.3
D61: Connects DEGT1 to CH.4
D71: Connects DEGT1 to BAINS1
D81: Connects DEGT1 to WC1

Step-by-step navigation plan:

1. Start in DEGT1
2. Use D41 to go from DEGT1 to SEJOUR1
3. Use D11 to go from SEJOUR1 to Porche1
4. Use D10 to go from Porche1 to CELLIER
5. Use D2 to go from CELLIER to CUISINE
6. Use D3 to go from CUISINE to SEJOUR
7. Use D4 to go from SEJOUR to DEGT

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D41"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D41"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D41"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan will efficiently guide you from DEGT1 to DEGT using the available doors in the floor plan.
