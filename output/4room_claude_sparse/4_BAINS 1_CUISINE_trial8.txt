Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from BAINS 1 to CUISINE.

Room and Door Connections:
- D11: connects BAINS 1 and HALL1
- D21: connects WC 1 and HALL1
- D31: connects CHAMBRE 4 and HALL1
- D41: connects CHAMBRE 4 and HALL1
- D51: connects CHAMBRE 3 and HALL1
- D61: connects HALL1 and PORCHE 1
- D71: connects PORCHE 1 and CUISINE 1
- D81: connects CUISINE 1 and TERRASSE COUVERTE 1
- D91: connects CELLIER 1 and GARAGE 1

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in BAINS 1
2. ApproachDoor(D11)
3. OpenDoor(D11)
4. GoThrough(D11) to enter HALL1
5. ApproachDoor(D61)
6. OpenDoor(D61)
7. GoThrough(D61) to enter PORCHE 1
8. ApproachDoor(D71)
9. OpenDoor(D71)
10. GoThrough(D71) to enter CUISINE 1 (destination reached)

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D71"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D71"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D71"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from BAINS 1 to CUISINE 1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
