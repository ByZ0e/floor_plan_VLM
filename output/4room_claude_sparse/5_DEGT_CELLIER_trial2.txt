Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms, doors, and their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from DEGT to CELLIER.

Room and Door Connections:
1. DEGT: connected to SEJOUR via D5, to CH.1 via D6, to WC via D8
2. SEJOUR: connected to DEGT via D5, to CUISINE via D3, to Porche via D1
3. CUISINE: connected to SEJOUR via D3, to CELLIER via D2
4. CELLIER: connected to CUISINE via D2, to Porche via D10
5. Porche: connected to SEJOUR via D1, to CELLIER via D10
6. CH.1: connected to DEGT via D6
7. CH.2: connected to DEGT via D9
8. WC: connected to DEGT via D8
9. BAINS: connected to DEGT via D7

Navigation Plan:
1. Start in DEGT
2. ApproachDoor(D5)
3. OpenDoor(D5)
4. GoThrough(D5)
5. ApproachDoor(D3)
6. OpenDoor(D3)
7. GoThrough(D3)
8. ApproachDoor(D2)
9. OpenDoor(D2)
10. GoThrough(D2)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan will efficiently guide you from DEGT to CELLIER using only the necessary doors and rooms.
