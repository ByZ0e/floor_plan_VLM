Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from DEGT to CELLIER.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

Rooms:
- DEGT
- SEJOUR
- CH.1
- CH.2
- CUISINE
- BAINS
- WC
- CELLIER
- Porche

Doors and their connections:
D1: Connects Porche and SEJOUR
D2: Connects SEJOUR and CELLIER
D3: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
D5: Connects DEGT and CH.1
D6: Connects DEGT and CH.2
D7: Connects DEGT and BAINS
D8: Connects DEGT and WC

Now, I'll provide the step-by-step navigation plan from DEGT to CELLIER:

1. ApproachDoor(4)
2. OpenDoor(4)
3. GoThrough(4)
4. ApproachDoor(2)
5. OpenDoor(2)
6. GoThrough(2)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from DEGT to CELLIER, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
