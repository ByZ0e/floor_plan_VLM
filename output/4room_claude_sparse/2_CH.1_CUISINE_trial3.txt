Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CH.1 connects to SEJOUR through D5
2. SEJOUR connects to DEGT through D4
3. DEGT connects to CH.2 through D6
4. DEGT connects to CUISINE through D3
5. SEJOUR connects to Porche through D1
6. Porche connects to CELLIER through D2
7. DEGT connects to WC through D8
8. DEGT connects to BAINS through D7

Step-by-step navigation plan from CH.1 to CUISINE:
1. ApproachDoor(D5)
2. OpenDoor(D5)
3. GoThrough(D5)
4. ApproachDoor(D4)
5. OpenDoor(D4)
6. GoThrough(D4)
7. ApproachDoor(D3)
8. OpenDoor(D3)
9. GoThrough(D3)

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CH.1",
  "end": "CUISINE",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from CH.1 to CUISINE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
