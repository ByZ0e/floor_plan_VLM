Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the GARAGE to the BUREAU.

Room and Door Connections:
1. GARAGE <-> D1 <-> CELLIER
2. CELLIER <-> D2 <-> PORCHE
3. PORCHE <-> D3 <-> LINGERIE
4. LINGERIE <-> D5 <-> BUREAU
5. BUREAU <-> D6 <-> BAINS

Navigation Plan:
To get from the GARAGE to the BUREAU, we need to go through the following rooms: GARAGE -> CELLIER -> PORCHE -> LINGERIE -> BUREAU

Here's the step-by-step plan:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the GARAGE to the BUREAU using only the necessary doors and rooms.
