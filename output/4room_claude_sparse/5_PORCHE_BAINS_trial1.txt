Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms, doors, and their connections, then provide a navigation plan from PORCHE to BAINS.

Explicit Room and Door Connections:
- D1: PORCHE <-> SEJOUR
- D2: PORCHE <-> CUISINE
- D3: SEJOUR <-> CUISINE
- D4: SEJOUR <-> DEGT
- D5: DEGT <-> CH.1
- D6: DEGT <-> CH.2
- D7: DEGT <-> BAINS
- D8: DEGT <-> WC

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in PORCHE
2. Use D2 to enter CUISINE
3. Use D3 to enter SEJOUR
4. Use D4 to enter DEGT
5. Use D7 to reach BAINS

Now, I'll provide the detailed action sequence in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan provides the most efficient route from PORCHE to BAINS using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
