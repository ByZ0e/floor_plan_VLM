Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms, doors, and their connections, then provide a navigation plan from DEGT to CELLIER.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

Rooms:
- DEGT
- SEJOUR
- CH.1
- CH.2
- CUISINE
- BAINS
- WC
- CELLIER
- Porche

Doors and their connections:
D1: Connects Porche and SEJOUR
D2: Connects SEJOUR and CELLIER
D3: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
D5: Connects DEGT and CH.1
D6: Connects DEGT and CH.2
D7: Connects DEGT and BAINS
D8: Connects DEGT and WC

Navigation Plan:
To go from DEGT to CELLIER, we need to use doors D4 and D2. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(D4)
2. OpenDoor(D4)
3. GoThrough(D4)
4. ApproachDoor(D2)
5. OpenDoor(D2)
6. GoThrough(D2)

JSON format of the final path:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"}
  ]
}
```

This path takes you from DEGT through SEJOUR and finally to CELLIER using the most direct route available based on the floor plan provided.
