Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the WC to HALL 1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. WC1 - D41 - LINGERIE1
2. LINGERIE1 - D51 - BUREAU1
3. BUREAU1 - D61 - BAINS1
4. BAINS1 - D71 - HALL1
5. PORCHE1 - D31 - LINGERIE1
6. CELLIER1 - D111 - HALL1
7. GARAGE1 - D13 - CELLIER1

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in WC1
2. Use D41 to enter LINGERIE1
3. Use D51 to enter BUREAU1
4. Use D61 to enter BAINS1
5. Use D71 to enter HALL1

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D41"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D41"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D41"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D51"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D51"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D51"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D71"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D71"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D71"}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan will efficiently guide you from the WC to HALL 1 using only the necessary doors along the path.
