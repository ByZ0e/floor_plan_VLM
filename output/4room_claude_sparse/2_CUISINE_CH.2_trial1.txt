Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from CUISINE to CH.2.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects Porche and Sejour
- D2: Connects Cellier and Sejour
- D3: Connects Cuisine and Sejour
- D4: Connects Sejour and Degt
- D5: Connects CH.1 and Degt
- D6: Connects CH.2 and Degt
- D7: Connects Bains and Degt
- D8: Connects WC and Degt

Now, let's create the navigation plan from CUISINE to CH.2:

1. Start in CUISINE
2. ApproachDoor(3)
3. OpenDoor(3)
4. GoThrough(3) [Now in SEJOUR]
5. ApproachDoor(4)
6. OpenDoor(4)
7. GoThrough(4) [Now in DEGT]
8. ApproachDoor(6)
9. OpenDoor(6)
10. GoThrough(6) [Now in CH.2]

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CUISINE",
  "end": "CH.2",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from CUISINE to CH.2, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
