Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide the navigation plan based on that information.

Room and Door Connections:

D1: Connects CELLIER and HALL
D2: Connects WC and HALL
D3: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 1
D4: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 1
D5: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 2
D6: Connects HALL and PORCHE
D7: Connects CUISINE and PORCHE
D8: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Connects CELLIER and GARAGE

Step-by-step navigation plan:

1. Start in TERRASSE COUVERTE
2. ApproachDoor(D8)
3. OpenDoor(D8)
4. GoThrough(D8) to enter CUISINE
5. ApproachDoor(D7)
6. OpenDoor(D7)
7. GoThrough(D7) to enter PORCHE
8. ApproachDoor(D6)
9. OpenDoor(D6)
10. GoThrough(D6) to enter HALL
11. ApproachDoor(D3)
12. OpenDoor(D3)
13. GoThrough(D3) to enter CHAMBRE 1

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to CHAMBRE 1 using only the necessary doors and rooms.
