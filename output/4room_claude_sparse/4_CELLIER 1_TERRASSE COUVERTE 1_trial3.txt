Thank you for providing the floor plan image. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from CELLIER 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE 1.

Room and Door Connections:

1. D91: Connects CELLIER 1 and HALL1
2. D11: Connects HALL1 and BAINS 1
3. D21: Connects BAINS 1 and WC 1
4. D31: Connects HALL1 and CHAMBRE 4
5. D41: Connects HALL1 and CHAMBRE 3
6. D51: Connects HALL1 and PORCHE 1
7. D61: Connects PORCHE 1 and CUISINE 1
8. D71: Connects CUISINE 1 and PORCHE 1
9. D81: Connects CUISINE 1 and TERRASSE COUVERTE 1

Navigation Plan:

To go from CELLIER 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE 1, we need to follow these steps:

1. ApproachDoor(D91)
2. OpenDoor(D91)
3. GoThrough(D91)
4. ApproachDoor(D51)
5. OpenDoor(D51)
6. GoThrough(D51)
7. ApproachDoor(D61)
8. OpenDoor(D61)
9. GoThrough(D61)
10. ApproachDoor(D81)
11. OpenDoor(D81)
12. GoThrough(D81)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D91"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D91"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D91"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D51"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D51"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D51"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D81"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D81"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D81"}
  ]
}
```

This path takes you from CELLIER 1 through HALL1, PORCHE 1, and CUISINE 1 to finally reach TERRASSE COUVERTE 1. It uses only the necessary doors and avoids any unnecessary rooms or detours.
