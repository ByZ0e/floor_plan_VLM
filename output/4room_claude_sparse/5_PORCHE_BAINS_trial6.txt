Thank you for providing the floor plan image. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from PORCHE to BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
1. PORCHE connects to SEJOUR through D1
2. SEJOUR connects to CUISINE through D3
3. CUISINE connects to CELLIER through D2
4. CUISINE connects to WC through D8
5. CUISINE connects to BAINS through D7
6. SEJOUR connects to CH.1 through D5
7. SEJOUR connects to DEGT through D4
8. DEGT connects to CH.2 through D6
9. CH.2 connects to CH.4 through D9

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in PORCHE
2. ApproachDoor(D1)
3. OpenDoor(D1)
4. GoThrough(D1) to enter SEJOUR
5. ApproachDoor(D3)
6. OpenDoor(D3)
7. GoThrough(D3) to enter CUISINE
8. ApproachDoor(D7)
9. OpenDoor(D7)
10. GoThrough(D7) to reach BAINS

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from PORCHE to BAINS using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
