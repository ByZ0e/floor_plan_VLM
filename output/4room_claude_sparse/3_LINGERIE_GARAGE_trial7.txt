Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the LINGERIE to the GARAGE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER
2. D2: Connects CELLIER and PORCHE
3. D3: Connects PORCHE and LINGERIE
4. D4: Connects LINGERIE and WC (not needed for this route)
5. D5: Connects LINGERIE and BUREAU (not needed for this route)
6. D6: Connects BUREAU and BAINS (not needed for this route)
7. D7: Connects BAINS and CHAMBRE PARENTS (not needed for this route)
8. D8: Connects CHAMBRE PARENTS and CHAMBRE ENFANT 2 (not needed for this route)
9. D9: Connects CHAMBRE ENFANT 2 and CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 (not needed for this route)
10. D10: Connects CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 and HALL (not needed for this route)
11. D11: Connects CELLIER and HALL (not needed for this route)

Navigation Plan:
To go from LINGERIE to GARAGE, we need to use doors D3, D2, and D1 in that order.

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in LINGERIE
2. ApproachDoor(D3)
3. OpenDoor(D3)
4. GoThrough(D3) to enter PORCHE
5. ApproachDoor(D2)
6. OpenDoor(D2)
7. GoThrough(D2) to enter CELLIER
8. ApproachDoor(D1)
9. OpenDoor(D1)
10. GoThrough(D1) to enter GARAGE

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"}
  ]
}
```

This path efficiently navigates from LINGERIE to GARAGE using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
