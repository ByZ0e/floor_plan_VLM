Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the relevant rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from PORCHE1 to CELLIER 1.

Relevant Room and Door Connections:
- PORCHE1 connects to GARAGE1 via D21
- PORCHE1 connects to CELLIER1 via D31

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in PORCHE1
2. Approach door D31 (which connects PORCHE1 to CELLIER1)
3. Open door D31
4. Go through door D31 to enter CELLIER1

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D31"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D31"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D31"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from PORCHE1 to CELLIER1 using only the necessary doors.
