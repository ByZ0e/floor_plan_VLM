Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from CH.1 to CUISINE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CH.1 connects to SEJOUR through D5
2. SEJOUR connects to CH.1 through D5
3. SEJOUR connects to DEGT through D4
4. DEGT connects to SEJOUR through D4
5. DEGT connects to CUISINE through D3
6. CUISINE connects to DEGT through D3

Navigation Plan:
To go from CH.1 to CUISINE, we need to pass through SEJOUR and DEGT. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(D5)
2. OpenDoor(D5)
3. GoThrough(D5)
4. ApproachDoor(D4)
5. OpenDoor(D4)
6. GoThrough(D4)
7. ApproachDoor(D3)
8. OpenDoor(D3)
9. GoThrough(D3)

JSON format of the navigation plan:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from CH.1 to CUISINE using only the necessary doors and rooms.
