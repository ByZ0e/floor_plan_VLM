Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the CUISINE to CH.2.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects Porche and Sejour
2. D2: Connects Cellier and Sejour
3. D3: Connects Sejour and Cuisine
4. D4: Connects Sejour and Degt
5. D5: Connects CH.1 and Degt
6. D6: Connects CH.2 and Degt
7. D7: Connects Degt and Bains
8. D8: Connects Degt and WC

Navigation Plan:
Starting from the CUISINE, we need to reach CH.2. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(D3)
2. OpenDoor(D3)
3. GoThrough(D3)
4. ApproachDoor(D4)
5. OpenDoor(D4)
6. GoThrough(D4)
7. ApproachDoor(D6)
8. OpenDoor(D6)
9. GoThrough(D6)

Here's the plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the CUISINE to CH.2 using only the necessary doors. The robot will start in the CUISINE, go through D3 to enter the SEJOUR, then through D4 to enter the DEGT, and finally through D6 to reach CH.2.
