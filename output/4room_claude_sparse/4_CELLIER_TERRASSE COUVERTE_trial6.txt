Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CELLIER: Connected to GARAGE via D9, and to HALL via D1
2. GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER via D9
3. HALL: Connected to CELLIER via D1, CHAMBRE 2 via D5, BAINS via D2, CHAMBRE 1 via D3, and PORCHE via D6
4. BAINS: Connected to HALL via D2, and WC via D4
5. WC: Connected to BAINS via D4
6. CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D3
7. CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL via D5
8. PORCHE: Connected to HALL via D6, and CUISINE via D7
9. CUISINE: Connected to PORCHE via D7, and TERRASSE COUVERTE via D8
10. TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE via D8

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in CELLIER
2. ApproachDoor(D1)
3. OpenDoor(D1)
4. GoThrough(D1) to enter HALL
5. ApproachDoor(D6)
6. OpenDoor(D6)
7. GoThrough(D6) to enter PORCHE
8. ApproachDoor(D7)
9. OpenDoor(D7)
10. GoThrough(D7) to enter CUISINE
11. ApproachDoor(D8)
12. OpenDoor(D8)
13. GoThrough(D8) to reach TERRASSE COUVERTE

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan provides the most efficient path from the CELLIER to the TERRASSE COUVERTE, using only the necessary doors and rooms along the way.
