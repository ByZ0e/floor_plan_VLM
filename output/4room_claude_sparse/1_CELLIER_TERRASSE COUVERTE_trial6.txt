Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the CELLIER to the TERRASSE COUVERTE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CELLIER - D1 - HALL
2. HALL - D2 - BAINS
3. HALL - D3 - WC
4. HALL - D4 - CHAMBRE 1
5. HALL - D5 - CHAMBRE 2
6. HALL - D6 - PORCHE
7. PORCHE - D7 - CUISINE
8. CUISINE - D8 - TERRASSE COUVERTE
9. CELLIER - D9 - GARAGE

Navigation Plan:
To get from the CELLIER to the TERRASSE COUVERTE, we need to go through the following rooms: CELLIER -> HALL -> PORCHE -> CUISINE -> TERRASSE COUVERTE.

Here's the step-by-step navigation plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the CELLIER to the TERRASSE COUVERTE using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
