Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the connections and provide a navigation plan as requested.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D9: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER
D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
D2: Connects HALL to BAINS
D3: Connects HALL to WC
D4: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 2
D6: Connects HALL to PORCHE
D7: Connects PORCHE to CUISINE
D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
D10: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE to exterior

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in GARAGE
2. Use D9 to enter CELLIER
3. Use D1 to enter HALL
4. Use D3 to reach WC

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from the GARAGE to the WC, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
