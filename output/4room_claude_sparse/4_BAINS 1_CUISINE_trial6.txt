Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll first list out the rooms and their door connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from BAINS 1 to CUISINE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. BAINS 1: Connected to HALL1 via D21
2. HALL1: Connected to BAINS 1 via D21, CHAMBRE 4 via D41, PORCHE 1 via D61
3. CHAMBRE 4: Connected to HALL1 via D41
4. PORCHE 1: Connected to HALL1 via D61, CUISINE 1 via D71
5. CUISINE 1: Connected to PORCHE 1 via D71

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
1. Start in BAINS 1
2. ApproachDoor(D21)
3. OpenDoor(D21)
4. GoThrough(D21) to enter HALL1
5. ApproachDoor(D61)
6. OpenDoor(D61)
7. GoThrough(D61) to enter PORCHE 1
8. ApproachDoor(D71)
9. OpenDoor(D71)
10. GoThrough(D71) to enter CUISINE 1

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D21"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D21"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D21"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D71"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D71"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D71"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from BAINS 1 to CUISINE 1 (which is labeled as CUISINE in the task), using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
