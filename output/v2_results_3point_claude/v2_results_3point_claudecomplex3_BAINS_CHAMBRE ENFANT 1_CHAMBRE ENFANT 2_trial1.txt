Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D6: Connects BUREAU and HALL
2. D7: Connects BAINS and HALL
3. D8: Connects CHAMBRE PARENTS and HALL
4. D9: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
5. D10: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 1

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
1. Start in BAINS
2. Exit BAINS to HALL
3. Move through HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
4. Exit CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 to HALL
5. Move from HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2

Now, I'll provide the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 10},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 10},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 9}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from BAINS to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 and then to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
