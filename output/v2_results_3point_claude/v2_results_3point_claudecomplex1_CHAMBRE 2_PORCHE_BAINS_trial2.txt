Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects CELLIER and HALL
- D2: Connects BAINS and HALL
- D3: Connects WC and HALL
- D4: Connects CHAMBRE 1 and HALL
- D5: Connects CHAMBRE 2 and HALL
- D6: Connects PORCHE and HALL
- D7: Connects CUISINE and HALL
- D8: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
- D9: Connects CELLIER and GARAGE

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in CHAMBRE 2
2. Use D5 to enter HALL
3. Cross HALL to reach D6
4. Use D6 to enter PORCHE
5. Return through D6 to HALL
6. Cross HALL to reach D2
7. Use D2 to enter BAINS

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CHAMBRE 2 to PORCHE and then to BAINS, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
