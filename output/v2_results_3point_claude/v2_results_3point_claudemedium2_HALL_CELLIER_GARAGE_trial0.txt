Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan based on those connections.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects GARAGE and HALL
2. D2: Connects CHAMBRE1 and HALL
3. D3: Connects WC and HALL
4. D4: Connects BAINS and HALL
5. D5: Connects CHAMBRE3 and HALL
6. D6: Connects CHAMBRE2 and HALL
7. D7: Connects CELLIER and HALL
8. D8: Connects HALL and Porche

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in HALL
2. Approach and go through D7 to enter CELLIER
3. Return to HALL through D7
4. Approach and go through D1 to reach GARAGE

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the HALL to CELLIER and then to GARAGE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
