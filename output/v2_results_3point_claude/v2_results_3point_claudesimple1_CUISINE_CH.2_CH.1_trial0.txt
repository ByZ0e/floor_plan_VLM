Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a detailed navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
- CUISINE: Connected to SEJOUR via D5
- SEJOUR: Connected to CUISINE via D5, to CH.2 via D3, to CH.1 via D4, and to another part of SEJOUR via D6
- CH.2: Connected to SEJOUR via D3, and to CH.3 via D2
- CH.1: Connected to SEJOUR via D4
- CH.3: Connected to CH.2 via D2, and to another part of SEJOUR via D1

Navigation Plan:
Starting from CUISINE, going to CH.2, and then to CH.1.

Step-by-step solution:
1. From CUISINE to CH.2:
   - ApproachDoor(D5)
   - OpenDoor(D5)
   - GoThrough(D5)
   - ApproachDoor(D3)
   - OpenDoor(D3)
   - GoThrough(D3)

2. From CH.2 to CH.1:
   - ApproachDoor(D3)
   - OpenDoor(D3)
   - GoThrough(D3)
   - ApproachDoor(D4)
   - OpenDoor(D4)
   - GoThrough(D4)

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the CUISINE to CH.2 and then to CH.1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
