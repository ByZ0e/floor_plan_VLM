Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan based on this information.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
- D2: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to HALL
- D3: Connects BAINS to HALL
- D4: Connects WC to HALL
- D5: Connects PORCHE to HALL
- D6: Connects CHAMBRE 1 to HALL
- D7: Connects CUISINE to HALL
- D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
- D9: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER

Step-by-step navigation plan:

1. Start in CHAMBRE 1
2. ApproachDoor(D6)
3. OpenDoor(D6)
4. GoThrough(D6) to enter HALL
5. ApproachDoor(D7)
6. OpenDoor(D7)
7. GoThrough(D7) to enter CUISINE
8. ApproachDoor(D8)
9. OpenDoor(D8)
10. GoThrough(D8) to reach TERRASSE COUVERTE
11. ApproachDoor(D8)
12. OpenDoor(D8)
13. GoThrough(D8) to return to CUISINE
14. ApproachDoor(D7)
15. OpenDoor(D7)
16. GoThrough(D7) to arrive at HALL

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CHAMBRE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE and back to HALL, using only the necessary doors and following the given constraints.
