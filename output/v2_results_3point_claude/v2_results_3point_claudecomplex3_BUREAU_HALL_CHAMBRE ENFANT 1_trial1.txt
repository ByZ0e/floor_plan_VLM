Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
- D6: Connects BUREAU and HALL
- D7: Connects HALL and BAINS
- D8: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE PARENTS
- D9: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
- D10: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 1

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in BUREAU
2. Use D6 to enter HALL
3. From HALL, use D10 to enter CHAMBRE ENFANT 1

Now, I'll provide the detailed navigation plan in the requested format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 10}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the BUREAU to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1, using only the necessary doors (D6 and D10) and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
