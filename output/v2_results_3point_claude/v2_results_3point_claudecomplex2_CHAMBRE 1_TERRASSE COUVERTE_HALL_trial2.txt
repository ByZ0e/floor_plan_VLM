Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and their door connections, then provide a navigation plan based on these connections.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CHAMBRE 1 - connected to HALL via D6
2. CHAMBRE 2 - connected to HALL via D2
3. CUISINE - connected to HALL via D7, connected to TERRASSE COUVERTE via D8
4. GARAGE - connected to CELLIER via D9
5. CELLIER - connected to HALL via D1
6. BAINS - connected to HALL via D3
7. WC - connected to HALL via D4
8. PORCHE - connected to HALL via D5
9. TERRASSE COUVERTE - connected to CUISINE via D8

Navigation Plan:
Starting in CHAMBRE 1, we need to go to TERRASSE COUVERTE, and then to HALL.

Step-by-step solution:
1. From CHAMBRE 1 to HALL:
   - ApproachDoor(D6)
   - OpenDoor(D6)
   - GoThrough(D6)

2. From HALL to CUISINE:
   - ApproachDoor(D7)
   - OpenDoor(D7)
   - GoThrough(D7)

3. From CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE:
   - ApproachDoor(D8)
   - OpenDoor(D8)
   - GoThrough(D8)

4. From TERRASSE COUVERTE to CUISINE:
   - ApproachDoor(D8)
   - OpenDoor(D8)
   - GoThrough(D8)

5. From CUISINE to HALL:
   - ApproachDoor(D7)
   - OpenDoor(D7)
   - GoThrough(D7)

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CHAMBRE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE and back to HALL, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
