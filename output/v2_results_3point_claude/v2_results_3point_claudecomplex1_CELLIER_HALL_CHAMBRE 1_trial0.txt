Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the connections and provide a navigation plan for you to move from CELLIER to CHAMBRE 1 via HALL.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
D2: Connects HALL to BAINS
D3: Connects HALL to WC
D4: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 2
D6: Connects HALL to PORCHE
D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE
D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE

Step-by-step navigation plan:

1. Start in CELLIER
2. Use D1 to enter HALL
3. From HALL, use D4 to enter CHAMBRE 1

Now, I'll provide the detailed action sequence in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D4"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently guides you from CELLIER to CHAMBRE 1 via HALL, using only the necessary doors (D1 and D4) and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
