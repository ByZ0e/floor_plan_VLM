Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects CH.3 to SEJOUR
- D2: Connects CH.3 to CH.2
- D3: Connects CH.2 to SEJOUR
- D4: Connects CH.1 to SEJOUR
- D5: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
- D6: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in CH.1
2. Use D4 to enter SEJOUR
3. Use D3 to enter CH.2
4. Use D3 again to return to SEJOUR (final destination)

Now, I'll provide the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 3
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CH.1 to CH.2 and then to SEJOUR, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
