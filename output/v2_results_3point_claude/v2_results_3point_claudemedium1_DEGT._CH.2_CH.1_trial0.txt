Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects SEJOUR and Porche
D2: Connects CUISINE and Porche
D3: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
D5: Connects CH.1 and DEGT
D6: Connects CH.2 and DEGT
D7: Connects BAINS and DEGT
D8: Connects WC and DEGT

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in DEGT
2. Go to CH.2:
   - ApproachDoor(D6)
   - OpenDoor(D6)
   - GoThrough(D6)
3. Return to DEGT:
   - ApproachDoor(D6)
   - OpenDoor(D6)
   - GoThrough(D6)
4. Go to CH.1:
   - ApproachDoor(D5)
   - OpenDoor(D5)
   - GoThrough(D5)

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from DEGT to CH.2, then back to DEGT, and finally to CH.1, using only the necessary doors for traversal.
