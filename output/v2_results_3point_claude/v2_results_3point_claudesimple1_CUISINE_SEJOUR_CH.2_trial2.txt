Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects CH.3 and SEJOUR
2. D2 connects CH.2 and SEJOUR
3. D3 connects CH.2 and SEJOUR
4. D4 connects CH.1 and SEJOUR
5. D5 connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
6. D6 connects SEJOUR and CUISINE

Now, let's create a navigation plan to go from CUISINE to SEJOUR, and then to CH.2.

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CUISINE
2. Use D5 or D6 to enter SEJOUR
3. From SEJOUR, use D2 or D3 to enter CH.2

Based on this analysis, here's the efficient navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct route from the CUISINE to CH.2, passing through SEJOUR as required. It uses D5 to exit the CUISINE and enter SEJOUR, then D2 to enter CH.2 from SEJOUR. The plan avoids any unnecessary doors or rooms and ensures that each step is necessary for reaching the final destination.
