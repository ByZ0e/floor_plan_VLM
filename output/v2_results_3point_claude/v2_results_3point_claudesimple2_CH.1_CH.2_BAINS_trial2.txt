Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects CH.1 to HALL
D2: Connects CH.1 to CH.2
D3: Connects CH.2 to HALL
D4: Connects GARAGE to CUISINE
D5: Connects CUISINE to HALL

Now, let's create the navigation plan from CH.1 to CH.2, and then to BAINS:

Step 1: From CH.1 to CH.2
- ApproachDoor(D2)
- OpenDoor(D2)
- GoThrough(D2)

Step 2: From CH.2 to BAINS
- ApproachDoor(D3)
- OpenDoor(D3)
- GoThrough(D3)
- ApproachDoor(D1)
- OpenDoor(D1)
- GoThrough(D1)

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CH.1 to CH.2, and then to BAINS, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or paths.
