Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan as requested.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

Rooms:
1. TERRASSE COUVERTE
2. CUISINE (multiple instances)
3. CELLIER
4. CH. PARENTS (two rooms)
5. DOUCHE

Doors and their connections:
D1: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE to CUISINE
D2: Connects CUISINE to CELLIER
D3: Connects CUISINE to CH. PARENTS
D4: Connects CH. PARENTS to DOUCHE

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan from TERRASSE COUVERTE to CH. PARENTS, and then to CUISINE:

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in TERRASSE COUVERTE
2. Use D1 to enter CUISINE
3. Use D3 to enter CH. PARENTS
4. Use D3 again to return to CUISINE (final destination)

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 3
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to CH. PARENTS and then back to CUISINE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
