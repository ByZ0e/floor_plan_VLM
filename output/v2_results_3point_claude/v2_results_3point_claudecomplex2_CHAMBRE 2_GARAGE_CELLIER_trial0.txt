Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms, doors, and their connections, then provide a navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
- CHAMBRE 2 connects to HALL via D2
- HALL connects to GARAGE via D9
- HALL connects to CELLIER via D1
- GARAGE connects to CELLIER via D9

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
1. Start in CHAMBRE 2
2. Use D2 to enter HALL
3. Use D9 to enter GARAGE
4. Use D9 again to enter CELLIER

Here's the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CHAMBRE 2 to GARAGE and finally to CELLIER, using only the necessary doors along the path. The plan accounts for doors closing after each GoThrough action, ensuring that each door is approached and opened before passing through.
