Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and their door connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan based on these connections.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CHAMBRE 2 - connected to HALL via D2
2. HALL - connected to WC via D4, to CUISINE via D7, to PORCHE via D5
3. WC - connected to HALL via D4
4. CUISINE - connected to HALL via D7, to TERRASSE COUVERTE via D8
5. GARAGE - connected to CELLIER via D9
6. CELLIER - connected to HALL via D1, to GARAGE via D9
7. CHAMBRE 1 - connected to HALL via D6
8. PORCHE - connected to HALL via D5

Now, let's create the navigation plan:

Step 1: From CHAMBRE 2 to WC
1. ApproachDoor(D2)
2. OpenDoor(D2)
3. GoThrough(D2)
4. ApproachDoor(D4)
5. OpenDoor(D4)
6. GoThrough(D4)

Step 2: From WC to GARAGE
1. ApproachDoor(D4)
2. OpenDoor(D4)
3. GoThrough(D4)
4. ApproachDoor(D1)
5. OpenDoor(D1)
6. GoThrough(D1)
7. ApproachDoor(D9)
8. OpenDoor(D9)
9. GoThrough(D9)

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CHAMBRE 2 to WC, and then to GARAGE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
