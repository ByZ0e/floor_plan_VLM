Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects SEJOUR and Porche
D2: Connects CUISINE and Porche
D3: Connects CUISINE and SEJOUR
D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
D5: Connects CH.1 and DEGT
D6: Connects CH.2 and DEGT
D7: Connects BAINS and DEGT
D8: Connects WC and DEGT

Now, for the navigation task from DEGT to CUISINE to SEJOUR:

Step 1: DEGT to CUISINE
- ApproachDoor(D4)
- OpenDoor(D4)
- GoThrough(D4)
- ApproachDoor(D3)
- OpenDoor(D3)
- GoThrough(D3)

Step 2: CUISINE to SEJOUR
- ApproachDoor(D3)
- OpenDoor(D3)
- GoThrough(D3)

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from DEGT to CUISINE and then to SEJOUR using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
