Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a detailed navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
D2: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to HALL
D3: Connects BAINS to HALL
D4: Connects WC to HALL
D5: Connects PORCHE to HALL
D6: Connects CHAMBRE 1 to HALL
D7: Connects CUISINE to HALL
D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER

Step-by-step navigation plan:

1. Start in CHAMBRE 2
2. Use D2 to enter HALL
3. Use D4 to enter WC
4. Return to HALL through D4
5. Go through D1 to enter CELLIER
6. Use D9 to reach GARAGE

Now, I'll provide the detailed navigation plan in the requested format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CHAMBRE 2 to WC and then to GARAGE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
