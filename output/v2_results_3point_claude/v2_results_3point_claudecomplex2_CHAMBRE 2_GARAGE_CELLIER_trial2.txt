Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan based on these connections.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
2. D2: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to HALL
3. D3: Connects BAINS to HALL
4. D4: Connects WC to HALL
5. D5: Connects PORCHE to HALL
6. D6: Connects CHAMBRE 1 to HALL
7. D7: Connects CUISINE to HALL
8. D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
9. D9: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in CHAMBRE 2
2. ApproachDoor(D2)
3. OpenDoor(D2)
4. GoThrough(D2) to enter HALL
5. ApproachDoor(D9)
6. OpenDoor(D9)
7. GoThrough(D9) to enter GARAGE
8. ApproachDoor(D9)
9. OpenDoor(D9)
10. GoThrough(D9) to enter CELLIER

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CHAMBRE 2 to GARAGE and then to CELLIER, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
