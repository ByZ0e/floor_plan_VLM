Certainly! I'll analyze the floor plan, list the room and door connections, and then provide a detailed navigation plan for your task.

Explicit Room and Door Connections:

D1: Connects GARAGE and HALL
D2: Connects CHAMBRE1 and HALL
D3: Connects HALL and WC
D4: Connects HALL and BAINS
D5: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 3
D6: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 2
D7: Connects HALL and CELLIER
D8: Connects HALL and Porche

Step-by-step navigation plan:

1. Start in CHAMBRE 3
2. Use D5 to enter HALL
3. From HALL, use D4 to enter BAINS
4. From BAINS, use D4 to return to HALL

Now, I'll provide the detailed action sequence in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates you from CHAMBRE 3 to BAINS and then to HALL, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
