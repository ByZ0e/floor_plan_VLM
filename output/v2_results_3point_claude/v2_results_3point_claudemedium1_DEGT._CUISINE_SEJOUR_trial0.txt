Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan based on these connections.

Room and Door Connections:
1. DEGT: Connected to SEJOUR via D4, to CH.2 via D6, and to BAINS via D7
2. SEJOUR: Connected to DEGT via D4, to CUISINE via D3, and to another part of SEJOUR via D1
3. CUISINE: Connected to SEJOUR via D3, to CELLIER via D2
4. CH.1: Connected to SEJOUR via D5
5. CH.2: Connected to DEGT via D6
6. BAINS: Connected to DEGT via D7
7. WC: Connected to DEGT via D8
8. CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE via D2

Navigation Plan:
Starting in DEGT, we need to go to CUISINE and then to SEJOUR. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. From DEGT to CUISINE:
   - ApproachDoor(D4)
   - OpenDoor(D4)
   - GoThrough(D4)
   - ApproachDoor(D3)
   - OpenDoor(D3)
   - GoThrough(D3)

2. From CUISINE to SEJOUR:
   - ApproachDoor(D3)
   - OpenDoor(D3)
   - GoThrough(D3)

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from DEGT to CUISINE and then to SEJOUR using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
