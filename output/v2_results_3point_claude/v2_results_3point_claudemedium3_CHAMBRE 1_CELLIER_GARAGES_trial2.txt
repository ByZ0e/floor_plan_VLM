Certainly! I'll analyze the floor plan, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a detailed navigation plan based on your requirements.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

Rooms:
1. CHAMBRE 1
2. CELLIER
3. GARAGES
4. CUISINE (two instances)
5. DOUCHE
6. WC
7. HALL (multiple instances, connecting various rooms)

Doors and their connections:
D1: Connects GARAGES to HALL
D2: Connects DOUCHE to HALL
D3: Connects CELLIER to CUISINE
D4: Connects WC to HALL
D5: Connects CHAMBRE 1 to HALL
D6: Connects CUISINE to HALL
D7: Connects CUISINE to HALL

Now, let's create the navigation plan based on these connections:

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CHAMBRE 1
2. Use D5 to enter the HALL
3. Use D3 to enter the CELLIER
4. Use D3 to return to the CUISINE
5. Use D6 to enter the HALL
6. Use D1 to enter the GARAGES

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D5"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D5"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D5"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D3"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D3"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D3"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D3"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D3"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D3"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D6"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D6"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D6"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D1"
    }
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan efficiently guides you from CHAMBRE 1 to CELLIER and finally to GARAGES, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
