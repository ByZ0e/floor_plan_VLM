Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1 connects CH.3 and SEJOUR
- D2 connects CH.2 and SEJOUR
- D3 connects CH.2 and SEJOUR
- D4 connects CH.1 and SEJOUR
- D5 connects CUISINE and SEJOUR
- D6 connects CUISINE and SEJOUR

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
1. Start in CUISINE
2. Use D5 or D6 to enter SEJOUR
3. From SEJOUR, use D2 or D3 to enter CH.2
4. From CH.2, return to SEJOUR using D2 or D3
5. From SEJOUR, use D4 to enter CH.1

Now, I'll provide the detailed action sequence in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CUISINE to CH.2 and then to CH.1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
