Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects BAINS to HALL
D2: Connects CH.1 to HALL
D3: Connects CH.2 to HALL
D4: Connects GARAGE to CUISINE
D5: Connects CUISINE to HALL

Navigation Plan:
To go from BAINS to CUISINE, then to GARAGE, we'll use the following sequence:

1. Start in BAINS
2. Use D1 to enter HALL
3. Use D5 to enter CUISINE
4. Use D4 to enter GARAGE

Step-by-step solution:
1. From BAINS to CUISINE:
   - ApproachDoor(1)
   - OpenDoor(1)
   - GoThrough(1)
   - ApproachDoor(5)
   - OpenDoor(5)
   - GoThrough(5)

2. From CUISINE to GARAGE:
   - ApproachDoor(4)
   - OpenDoor(4)
   - GoThrough(4)

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from BAINS to CUISINE and then to GARAGE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
