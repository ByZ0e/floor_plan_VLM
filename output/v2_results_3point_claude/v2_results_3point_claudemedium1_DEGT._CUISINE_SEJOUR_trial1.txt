Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a detailed navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
D2: Connects CUISINE and CELLIER
D3: Connects CUISINE and SEJOUR
D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
D5: Connects DEGT and CH.1
D6: Connects DEGT and CH.2
D7: Connects DEGT and BAINS
D8: Connects DEGT and WC

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in DEGT
2. Go to CUISINE:
   - ApproachDoor(D4)
   - OpenDoor(D4)
   - GoThrough(D4) [Now in SEJOUR]
   - ApproachDoor(D3)
   - OpenDoor(D3)
   - GoThrough(D3) [Now in CUISINE]
3. Go to SEJOUR:
   - ApproachDoor(D3)
   - OpenDoor(D3)
   - GoThrough(D3) [Now in SEJOUR]

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from DEGT to CUISINE and then to SEJOUR using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
