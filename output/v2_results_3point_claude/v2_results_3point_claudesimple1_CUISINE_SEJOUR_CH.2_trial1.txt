Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects CH.3 and SEJOUR
2. D2 connects CH.2 and SEJOUR
3. D3 connects CH.2 and SEJOUR
4. D4 connects CH.1 and SEJOUR
5. D5 connects CUISINE and SEJOUR
6. D6 connects CUISINE and SEJOUR

Now, let's create the navigation plan from CUISINE to SEJOUR, and then to CH.2:

Step 1: CUISINE to SEJOUR
- ApproachDoor(5)
- OpenDoor(5)
- GoThrough(5)

Step 2: SEJOUR to CH.2
- ApproachDoor(3)
- OpenDoor(3)
- GoThrough(3)

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 5
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 5
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 5
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 3
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates you from the CUISINE to SEJOUR and then to CH.2 using the necessary doors. The plan avoids any unnecessary rooms or doors, ensuring a direct path to the final destination.
