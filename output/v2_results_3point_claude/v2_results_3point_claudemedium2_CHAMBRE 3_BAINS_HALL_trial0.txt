Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects GARAGE and HALL
- D2: Connects CHAMBRE1 and HALL
- D3: Connects HALL and WC
- D4: Connects HALL and BAINS
- D5: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 3
- D6: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 2
- D7: Connects HALL and CELLIER
- D8: Connects HALL and Porche

Navigation Plan:
Starting from CHAMBRE 3, the path to BAINS and then to HALL is as follows:

1. From CHAMBRE 3 to BAINS:
   - ApproachDoor(D5)
   - OpenDoor(D5)
   - GoThrough(D5)
   - ApproachDoor(D4)
   - OpenDoor(D4)
   - GoThrough(D4)

2. From BAINS to HALL:
   - ApproachDoor(D4)
   - OpenDoor(D4)
   - GoThrough(D4)

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CHAMBRE 3 to BAINS and then to HALL, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
