Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects CH.3 and SEJOUR
- D2: Connects CH.3 and CH.2
- D3: Connects CH.2 and SEJOUR
- D4: Connects CH.1 and SEJOUR
- D5: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
- D6: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in CUISINE
2. Go to CH.3
3. End in SEJOUR

Detailed navigation plan:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the CUISINE to CH.3 and then to SEJOUR using the necessary doors. It avoids unnecessary rooms and doors, providing a direct path to the destination.
