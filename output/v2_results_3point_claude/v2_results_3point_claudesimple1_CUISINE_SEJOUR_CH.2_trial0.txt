Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan based on your requirements.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects CH.3 and SEJOUR
- D2: Connects CH.2 and CH.3
- D3: Connects CH.2 and SEJOUR
- D4: Connects CH.1 and SEJOUR
- D5: Connects CUISINE and SEJOUR
- D6: Connects CUISINE and SEJOUR

Now, let's create the navigation plan to go from CUISINE to SEJOUR, then to CH.2:

Step 1: CUISINE to SEJOUR
1. ApproachDoor(5)
2. OpenDoor(5)
3. GoThrough(5)

Step 2: SEJOUR to CH.2
4. ApproachDoor(3)
5. OpenDoor(3)
6. GoThrough(3)

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates you from the CUISINE to SEJOUR, and then to CH.2, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
