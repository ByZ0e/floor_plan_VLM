Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan for your route from BAINS to CHAMBRE 2 and finally to WC.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects GARAGE and HALL
2. D2: Connects CHAMBRE 1 and HALL
3. D3: Connects HALL and WC
4. D4: Connects BAINS and HALL
5. D5: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 3
6. D6: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 2
7. D7: Connects HALL and CELLIER
8. D8: Connects HALL and Porche

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in BAINS
2. Exit BAINS to HALL through D4
3. Move through HALL to CHAMBRE 2
4. Enter CHAMBRE 2 through D6
5. Exit CHAMBRE 2 to HALL through D6
6. Move through HALL to WC
7. Enter WC through D3

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format using only the necessary actions:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently guides you from BAINS to CHAMBRE 2 and finally to WC, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
