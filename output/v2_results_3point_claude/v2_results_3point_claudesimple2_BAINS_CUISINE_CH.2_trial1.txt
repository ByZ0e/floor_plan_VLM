Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects BAINS to HALL
D2: Connects CH.1 to HALL
D3: Connects CH.2 to HALL
D4: Connects GARAGE to CUISINE
D5: Connects CUISINE to HALL

Now, let's create the navigation plan to go from BAINS to CUISINE to CH.2:

Step 1: BAINS to CUISINE
1. ApproachDoor(1)
2. OpenDoor(1)
3. GoThrough(1)
4. ApproachDoor(5)
5. OpenDoor(5)
6. GoThrough(5)

Step 2: CUISINE to CH.2
1. ApproachDoor(5)
2. OpenDoor(5)
3. GoThrough(5)
4. ApproachDoor(3)
5. OpenDoor(3)
6. GoThrough(3)

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from BAINS to CUISINE and then to CH.2, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
