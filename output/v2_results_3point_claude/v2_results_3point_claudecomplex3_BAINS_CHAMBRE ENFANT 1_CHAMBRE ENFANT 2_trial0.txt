Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan based on these connections.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D6: Connects BUREAU and BAINS
2. D7: Connects BAINS and HALL
3. D8: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE PARENTS
4. D9: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
5. D10: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 1

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
1. Start in BAINS
2. Go from BAINS to HALL using D7
3. Go from HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 using D10
4. Return to HALL using D10
5. Go from HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2 using D9

Now, I'll provide the detailed navigation plan in the requested format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 10},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 10},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 9}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from BAINS to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1, and then to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
