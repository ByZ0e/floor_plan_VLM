Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan based on those connections.

Room and Door Connections:
- CH.3 connects to SEJOUR through D1
- CH.2 connects to SEJOUR through D2 and D3
- CH.1 connects to SEJOUR through D4
- CUISINE connects to SEJOUR through D5 and D6

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in CH.3
2. Use D1 to enter SEJOUR
3. Cross SEJOUR to reach D3
4. Use D3 to enter CH.2
5. Exit CH.2 through D3 back to SEJOUR
6. Cross SEJOUR to reach D4
7. Use D4 to enter CH.1

Now, I'll provide the detailed action sequence in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CH.3 to CH.2 and then to CH.1 using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours or rooms.
