Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the connections and create a navigation plan for you.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER
D2: Connects CELLIER to PORCHE
D3: Connects PORCHE to HALL
D4: Connects HALL to WC
D5: Connects HALL to LINGERIE
D6: Connects HALL to BUREAU
D7: Connects HALL to BAINS
D8: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE PARENTS
D9: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
D10: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
D11: Connects CELLIER to HALL

Step-by-step solution:

1. Start in BUREAU
2. Use D6 to enter HALL
3. Use D10 to enter CHAMBRE ENFANT 1

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 10}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from BUREAU to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
