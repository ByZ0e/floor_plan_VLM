Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan as requested.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:
D1: Connects Garage to Hall
D2: Connects Chambre 1 to Hall
D3: Connects Hall to WC
D4: Connects Hall to Bains
D5: Connects Hall to Chambre 3
D6: Connects Hall to Chambre 2
D7: Connects Hall to Cellier
D8: Connects Hall to Porche

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in Hall
2. Go to Chambre 1:
   - ApproachDoor(D2)
   - OpenDoor(D2)
   - GoThrough(D2)
3. Return to Hall:
   - ApproachDoor(D2)
   - OpenDoor(D2)
   - GoThrough(D2)
4. Go to Chambre 2:
   - ApproachDoor(D6)
   - OpenDoor(D6)
   - GoThrough(D6)

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the Hall to Chambre 1, back to the Hall, and finally to Chambre 2, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
