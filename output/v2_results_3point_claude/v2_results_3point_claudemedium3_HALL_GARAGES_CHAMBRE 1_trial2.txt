Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and their door connections, then provide a navigation plan based on your requirements.

Room and Door Connections:
1. HALL connects to GARAGES via D1
2. HALL connects to DOUCHE via D2
3. HALL connects to CELLIER via D3
4. HALL connects to WC via D4
5. HALL connects to CHAMBRE 1 via D5
6. HALL connects to CUISINE (upper) via D6
7. HALL connects to CUISINE (lower) via D7

Now, let's create the navigation plan to go from HALL to GARAGES, and then to CHAMBRE 1:

Step 1: From HALL to GARAGES
- ApproachDoor(1)
- OpenDoor(1)
- GoThrough(1)

Step 2: From GARAGES to HALL
- ApproachDoor(1)
- OpenDoor(1)
- GoThrough(1)

Step 3: From HALL to CHAMBRE 1
- ApproachDoor(5)
- OpenDoor(5)
- GoThrough(5)

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "doorNumber": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "doorNumber": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "doorNumber": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "doorNumber": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "doorNumber": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "doorNumber": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "doorNumber": 5
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "doorNumber": 5
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "doorNumber": 5
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the HALL to GARAGES and then to CHAMBRE 1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
