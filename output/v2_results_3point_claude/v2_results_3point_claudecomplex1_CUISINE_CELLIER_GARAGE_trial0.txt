Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan based on those connections.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects CELLIER and HALL
D2: Connects BAINS and HALL
D3: Connects WC and HALL
D4: Connects CHAMBRE 1 and HALL
D5: Connects CHAMBRE 2 and HALL
D6: Connects PORCHE and HALL
D7: Connects CUISINE and HALL
D8: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Connects CELLIER and GARAGE

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in CUISINE
2. Use D7 to enter HALL
3. Use D1 to enter CELLIER
4. Use D9 to enter GARAGE

Now, I'll provide the detailed action sequence in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D7"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D7"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D7"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D9"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D9"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D9"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the CUISINE to the CELLIER and finally to the GARAGE using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
