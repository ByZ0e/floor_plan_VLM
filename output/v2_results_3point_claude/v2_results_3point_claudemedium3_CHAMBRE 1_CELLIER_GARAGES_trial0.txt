Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects GARAGES and CELLIER
D2: Connects GARAGES and DOUCHE
D3: Connects CELLIER and CUISINE
D4: Connects HALL and WC
D5: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 1
D6: Connects HALL and CUISINE
D7: Connects HALL and CUISINE (second instance)

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in CHAMBRE 1
2. Use D5 to enter HALL
3. Use D6 to enter CUISINE
4. Use D3 to enter CELLIER
5. Use D1 to enter GARAGES

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan will efficiently guide you from CHAMBRE 1 to CELLIER and finally to GARAGES, using only the necessary doors along the path.
