Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE to CUISINE
- D2: Connects CUISINE to CELLIER
- D3: Connects CUISINE to CH. PARENTS
- D4: Connects CH. PARENTS to DOUCHE

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
1. Start in DOUCHE
2. Go through D4 to enter CH. PARENTS
3. Go through D3 to enter CUISINE
4. Go through D1 to enter TERRASSE COUVERTE
5. Go back through D1 to enter CUISINE
6. Go through D2 to reach CELLIER

Now, I'll provide the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan will efficiently guide you from the DOUCHE to the TERRASSE COUVERTE and finally to the CELLIER, using only the necessary doors and following the most direct path based on the floor plan provided.
