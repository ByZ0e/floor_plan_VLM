Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan for your task.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects GARAGES to CELLIER
D2: Connects GARAGES to DOUCHE
D3: Connects CELLIER to CUISINE
D4: Connects WC to HALL
D5: Connects CHAMBRE 1 to HALL
D6: Connects CUISINE to HALL
D7: Connects CUISINE to HALL

Now, let's create the navigation plan to go from CHAMBRE 1 to CELLIER:

Step 1: Exit CHAMBRE 1
Step 2: Navigate through HALL
Step 3: Enter CUISINE
Step 4: Enter CELLIER

Here's the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 5
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 5
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 5
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 6
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 6
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 6
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 3
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently guides you from CHAMBRE 1 to CELLIER using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
