Certainly! I'll analyze the floor plan, list the room and door connections, and then provide a detailed navigation plan for your route from CHAMBRE 2 to WC, and finally to GARAGE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
2. D2: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to HALL
3. D3: Connects HALL to BAINS
4. D4: Connects HALL to WC
5. D5: Connects HALL to PORCHE
6. D6: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
7. D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE
8. D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
9. D9: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER

Step-by-step navigation plan:

1. Start in CHAMBRE 2
2. Go to WC:
   - ApproachDoor(D2)
   - OpenDoor(D2)
   - GoThrough(D2)
   - ApproachDoor(D4)
   - OpenDoor(D4)
   - GoThrough(D4)

3. Go from WC to GARAGE:
   - ApproachDoor(D4)
   - OpenDoor(D4)
   - GoThrough(D4)
   - ApproachDoor(D1)
   - OpenDoor(D1)
   - GoThrough(D1)
   - ApproachDoor(D9)
   - OpenDoor(D9)
   - GoThrough(D9)

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan efficiently guides you from CHAMBRE 2 to WC, and then to GARAGE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
