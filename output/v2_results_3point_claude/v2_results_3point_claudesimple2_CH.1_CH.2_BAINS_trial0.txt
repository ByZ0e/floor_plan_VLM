Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll first list the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CH.1 connects to the hall through D2
2. CH.2 connects to the hall through D3
3. BAINS connects to the hall through D1
4. GARAGE connects to CUISINE through D4
5. CUISINE connects to the hall through D5

Now, let's create the navigation plan:

Step 1: From CH.1 to CH.2
- ApproachDoor(D2)
- OpenDoor(D2)
- GoThrough(D2)
- ApproachDoor(D3)
- OpenDoor(D3)
- GoThrough(D3)

Step 2: From CH.2 to BAINS
- ApproachDoor(D3)
- OpenDoor(D3)
- GoThrough(D3)
- ApproachDoor(D1)
- OpenDoor(D1)
- GoThrough(D1)

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CH.1 to CH.2 and then to BAINS, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
