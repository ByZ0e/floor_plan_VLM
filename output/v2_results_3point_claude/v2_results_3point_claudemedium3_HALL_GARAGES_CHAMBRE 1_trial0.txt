Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. Let me first describe the rooms and doors with their connections based on the image:

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects GARAGES and CELLIER
2. D2 connects GARAGES and DOUCHE
3. D3 connects CELLIER and CUISINE
4. D4 connects WC and HALL
5. D5 connects HALL and CHAMBRE 1
6. D6 connects HALL and CUISINE
7. D7 connects HALL and CUISINE (second entrance)

Now, let's create a step-by-step navigation plan to go from HALL to GARAGES, and then to CHAMBRE 1:

1. Start in HALL
2. ApproachDoor(6)
3. OpenDoor(6)
4. GoThrough(6) - Now in CUISINE
5. ApproachDoor(3)
6. OpenDoor(3)
7. GoThrough(3) - Now in CELLIER
8. ApproachDoor(1)
9. OpenDoor(1)
10. GoThrough(1) - Now in GARAGES
11. ApproachDoor(1)
12. OpenDoor(1)
13. GoThrough(1) - Now back in CELLIER
14. ApproachDoor(3)
15. OpenDoor(3)
16. GoThrough(3) - Now back in CUISINE
17. ApproachDoor(6)
18. OpenDoor(6)
19. GoThrough(6) - Now back in HALL
20. ApproachDoor(5)
21. OpenDoor(5)
22. GoThrough(5) - Now in CHAMBRE 1

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the HALL to GARAGES and then to CHAMBRE 1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
