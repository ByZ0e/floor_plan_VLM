Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects BAINS to HALL
- D2: Connects CH.1 to HALL
- D3: Connects CH.2 to HALL
- D4: Connects GARAGE to CUISINE
- D5: Connects CUISINE to HALL

Navigation Plan:

To go from BAINS to CUISINE, then to GARAGE, we need to use doors D1, D5, and D4 in that order. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. Start in BAINS
2. ApproachDoor(D1)
3. OpenDoor(D1)
4. GoThrough(D1) - Now in HALL
5. ApproachDoor(D5)
6. OpenDoor(D5)
7. GoThrough(D5) - Now in CUISINE
8. ApproachDoor(D4)
9. OpenDoor(D4)
10. GoThrough(D4) - Now in GARAGE

Here's the plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from BAINS to CUISINE and then to GARAGE using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
