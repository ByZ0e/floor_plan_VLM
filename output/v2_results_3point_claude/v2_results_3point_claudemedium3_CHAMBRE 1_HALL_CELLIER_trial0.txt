Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list the explicit room and door connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan based on these connections.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects GARAGES to CELLIER
D2: Connects GARAGES to DOUCHE
D3: Connects CELLIER to CUISINE
D4: Connects WC to HALL
D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
D6: Connects HALL to CUISINE
D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE (second entrance)

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in CHAMBRE 1
2. ApproachDoor(D5)
3. OpenDoor(D5)
4. GoThrough(D5) to enter HALL
5. ApproachDoor(D6)
6. OpenDoor(D6)
7. GoThrough(D6) to enter CUISINE
8. ApproachDoor(D3)
9. OpenDoor(D3)
10. GoThrough(D3) to reach CELLIER

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from CHAMBRE 1 to CELLIER using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
