Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects SEJOUR and CH.3
D2: Connects CH.2 and CH.3
D3: Connects CH.2 and SEJOUR
D4: Connects CH.1 and SEJOUR
D5: Connects CUISINE and SEJOUR
D6: Connects CUISINE and SEJOUR

Now, let's create the navigation plan based on these connections:

Step 1: CUISINE to CH.3
- ApproachDoor(D5)
- OpenDoor(D5)
- GoThrough(D5)
- ApproachDoor(D1)
- OpenDoor(D1)
- GoThrough(D1)

Step 2: CH.3 to SEJOUR
- ApproachDoor(D1)
- OpenDoor(D1)
- GoThrough(D1)

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CUISINE to CH.3 and then to SEJOUR, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
