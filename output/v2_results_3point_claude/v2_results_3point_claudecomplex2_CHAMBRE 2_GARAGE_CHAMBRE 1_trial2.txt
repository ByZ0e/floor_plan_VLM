Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan based on these connections.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects Cellier to Hall
2. D2: Connects Chambre 2 to Hall
3. D3: Connects Hall to Bains
4. D4: Connects Hall to WC
5. D5: Connects Chambre 2 to Porche
6. D6: Connects Hall to Chambre 1
7. D7: Connects Cuisine to Hall
8. D8: Connects Cuisine to Terrasse Couverte
9. D9: Connects Garage to Cellier

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in Chambre 2
2. ApproachDoor(D2)
3. OpenDoor(D2)
4. GoThrough(D2) to enter Hall
5. ApproachDoor(D1)
6. OpenDoor(D1)
7. GoThrough(D1) to enter Cellier
8. ApproachDoor(D9)
9. OpenDoor(D9)
10. GoThrough(D9) to enter Garage
11. ApproachDoor(D9)
12. OpenDoor(D9)
13. GoThrough(D9) to return to Cellier
14. ApproachDoor(D1)
15. OpenDoor(D1)
16. GoThrough(D1) to return to Hall
17. ApproachDoor(D6)
18. OpenDoor(D6)
19. GoThrough(D6) to enter Chambre 1

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from Chambre 2 to Garage and then to Chambre 1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
