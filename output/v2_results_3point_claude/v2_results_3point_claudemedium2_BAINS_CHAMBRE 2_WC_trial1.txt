Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan as requested.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

1. D1: Connects Garage to Hall
2. D2: Connects Chambre 1 to Hall
3. D3: Connects Hall to WC
4. D4: Connects Bains to Hall
5. D5: Connects Hall to Chambre 3
6. D6: Connects Hall to Chambre 2
7. D7: Connects Hall to Cellier
8. D8: Connects Hall to Porche

Step-by-step solution:

1. Start in Bains
2. Go from Bains to Hall through D4
3. Go from Hall to Chambre 2 through D6
4. Return from Chambre 2 to Hall through D6
5. Go from Hall to WC through D3

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from Bains to Chambre 2 and then to WC, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
