Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from CELLIER to CHAMBRE 1.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
- D2: Connects HALL to BAINS
- D3: Connects HALL to WC
- D4: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
- D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 2
- D6: Connects HALL to PORCHE
- D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE
- D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
- D9: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in CELLIER
2. Use D1 to enter HALL
3. Use D4 to enter CHAMBRE 1

Here's the detailed action plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D4"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CELLIER to CHAMBRE 1 using only the necessary doors (D1 and D4) without any unnecessary detours.
