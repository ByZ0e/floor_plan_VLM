Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms, doors, and their connections, then provide a navigation plan as requested.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects GARAGE and HALL
D2: Connects CHAMBRE1 and HALL
D3: Connects HALL and WC
D4: Connects HALL and BAINS
D5: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 3
D6: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 2
D7: Connects HALL and CELLIER
D8: Connects HALL and Porche

Now, let's create the navigation plan from CHAMBRE 1 to BAINS, and then to GARAGE:

Step 1: CHAMBRE 1 to BAINS
1. ApproachDoor(D2)
2. OpenDoor(D2)
3. GoThrough(D2)
4. ApproachDoor(D4)
5. OpenDoor(D4)
6. GoThrough(D4)

Step 2: BAINS to GARAGE
7. ApproachDoor(D4)
8. OpenDoor(D4)
9. GoThrough(D4)
10. ApproachDoor(D1)
11. OpenDoor(D1)
12. GoThrough(D1)

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CHAMBRE 1 to BAINS, and then to GARAGE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
