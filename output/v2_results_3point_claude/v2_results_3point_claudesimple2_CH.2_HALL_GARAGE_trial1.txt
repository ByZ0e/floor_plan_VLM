Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan for your task.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects CH.1 and HALL
D2: Connects CH.1 and CH.2
D3: Connects CH.2 and HALL
D4: Connects GARAGE and CUISINE
D5: Connects CUISINE and HALL

Navigation Task: CH.2 to HALL to GARAGE

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CH.2
2. Use D3 to go from CH.2 to HALL
3. Use D4 to go from HALL to GARAGE (through CUISINE)

Here's the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 4
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates you from CH.2 to HALL and then to GARAGE, using only the necessary doors (D3 and D4) along the path. The plan takes into account that doors close after each GoThrough action, so each door needs to be approached and opened before going through.
