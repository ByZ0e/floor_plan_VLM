Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects CH.1 and HALL
D2: Connects CH.1 and CH.2
D3: Connects CH.2 and HALL
D4: Connects GARAGE and CUISINE
D5: Connects CUISINE and HALL

Now, let's create the navigation plan from CH.2 to GARAGE:

1. Start in CH.2
2. Use D3 to enter HALL
3. Move through HALL
4. Use D4 to enter GARAGE

Here's the detailed action plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CH.2 to GARAGE using only the necessary doors (D3 and D4) and passing through the HALL as required. The plan avoids any unnecessary rooms or doors, ensuring a direct path to the destination.
