Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the connections and provide a navigation plan as requested.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects HALL to BAINS
D2: Connects HALL to WC
D3: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
D4: Connects HALL to HALL (different sections)
D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 2
D6: Connects HALL to PORCHE
D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE
D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE
D10: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE to TERRASSE COUVERTE (outdoor area)

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in GARAGE
2. Go through D9 to enter CELLIER
3. Go through D9 again to enter GARAGE (as it's the only way to access the main living area)
4. Go through D9 once more to re-enter CELLIER
5. Move through CELLIER to reach HALL
6. In HALL, approach D2
7. Open D2
8. Go through D2 to reach WC

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the GARAGE to the WC using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
