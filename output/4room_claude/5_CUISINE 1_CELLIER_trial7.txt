Certainly! I'll analyze the floor plan, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from CUISINE 1 to CELLIER.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D21: Connects CELLIER1 and CUISINE 1
2. D31: Connects CUISINE 1 and SEJOUR1
3. D10: Connects SEJOUR1 and CELLIER
4. D2: Connects CUISINE and CELLIER
3. D3: Connects CUISINE and SEJOUR

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CUISINE 1
2. Use D21 to go from CUISINE 1 to CELLIER1
3. Use D31 to go from CELLIER1 to SEJOUR1
4. Use D10 to go from SEJOUR1 to CELLIER

Navigation Plan in JSON format:
```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 21},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 21},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 21},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 31},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 31},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 31},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 10}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CUISINE 1 to CELLIER using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors. The path goes through CELLIER1 and SEJOUR1 to reach the final destination of CELLIER.
