Certainly! I'll analyze the floor plan, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a detailed navigation plan as requested.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

Rooms:
1. PORCHE
2. SEJOUR (multiple instances)
3. CUISINE (two instances)
4. CELLIER
5. CH.1 (two instances)
6. CH.2 (multiple instances)
7. DEGT (Dégagement - hallway)
8. WC
9. BAINS

Doors and their connections:
D1: Connects PORCHE and SEJOUR
D2: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE (upper instance)
D3: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE (lower instance)
D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
D5: Connects CH.1 and DEGT
D6: Connects CH.2 and DEGT
D7: Connects DEGT and BAINS
D8: Connects DEGT and WC

Now, I'll provide the step-by-step navigation plan from PORCHE to BAINS:

1. ApproachDoor(1)
2. OpenDoor(1)
3. GoThrough(1)
4. ApproachDoor(4)
5. OpenDoor(4)
6. GoThrough(4)
7. ApproachDoor(7)
8. OpenDoor(7)
9. GoThrough(7)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan provides the most efficient path from PORCHE to BAINS, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
