Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the WC to the PORCHE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects SEJOUR to PORCHE
2. D2: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
3. D3: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
4. D4: Connects SEJOUR to DEGT
5. D5: Connects CH.1 to DEGT
6. D6: Connects CH.2 to DEGT
7. D7: Connects BAINS to DEGT
8. D8: Connects WC to DEGT

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in WC
2. Use D8 to enter DEGT
3. Use D4 to enter SEJOUR
4. Use D1 to reach PORCHE

Now, I'll provide the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "doorNumber": 8
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "doorNumber": 8
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "doorNumber": 8
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "doorNumber": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "doorNumber": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "doorNumber": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "doorNumber": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "doorNumber": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "doorNumber": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan provides the most efficient path from the WC to the PORCHE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
