Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the connections and provide a navigation plan as requested.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
D2: Connects BAINS to HALL
D3: Connects WC to HALL
D4: Connects CHAMBRE 1 to HALL
D5: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to HALL
D6: Connects PORCHE to HALL
D7: Connects CUISINE to HALL
D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE

Step-by-step solution:

1. Start in PORCHE
2. Use D6 to enter HALL
3. Move through HALL
4. Use D1 to enter CELLIER
5. Use D9 to reach GARAGE

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 9}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the PORCHE to the GARAGE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
