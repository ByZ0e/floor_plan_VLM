Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
D8: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE and CUISINE
D7: Connects CUISINE and HALL
D6: Connects HALL and PORCHE
D5: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 2
D4: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 1
D3: Connects HALL and WC
D2: Connects HALL and BAINS
D1: Connects HALL and CELLIER
D9: Connects CELLIER and GARAGE

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
1. Start in TERRASSE COUVERTE
2. Approach and go through D8 to enter CUISINE
3. Approach and go through D7 to enter HALL
4. Approach and go through D4 to reach CHAMBRE 1

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from TERRASSE COUVERTE to CHAMBRE 1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
