Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from PORCHE 1 to CELLIER.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D21 connects PORCHE1 and CELLIER 1
2. D31 connects PORCHE1 and HALL1
3. D41 connects HALL1 and WC1
4. D51 connects HALL1 and LINGERIE1
5. D61 connects HALL1 and BUREAU1
6. D71 connects HALL1 and BAINS1
7. D81 connects HALL1 and CHAMBRE PARENTS1
8. D91 connects HALL1 and CHAMBRE ENFANT 21
9. D101 connects HALL1 and CHAMBRE ENFANT 11
10. D111 connects CELLIER 1 and HALL1
11. D13 connects GARAGE1 and CELLIER 1
12. D12 connects HALL1 and PORCHE

Navigation Plan:
To go from PORCHE 1 to CELLIER, we only need to use one door:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 21},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 21},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 21}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from PORCHE 1 to CELLIER using the most direct route available. The robot will approach door D21, open it, and go through to reach the CELLIER directly from PORCHE 1.
