Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the relevant rooms and doors, and then provide a navigation plan from PORCHE 1 to CELLIER.

Relevant Rooms and Doors:
1. PORCHE 1: Connected to HALL 1 via door D31
2. HALL 1: Connected to CELLIER 1 via door D13
3. CELLIER 1: Final destination

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
1. Start in PORCHE 1
2. Use door D31 to enter HALL 1
3. Use door D13 to enter CELLIER 1

Now, I'll provide the detailed navigation plan in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D31"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D31"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D31"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D13"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D13"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D13"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from PORCHE 1 to CELLIER 1 using only the necessary doors. The robot will start in PORCHE 1, go through door D31 to enter HALL 1, and then use door D13 to reach the final destination, CELLIER 1.
