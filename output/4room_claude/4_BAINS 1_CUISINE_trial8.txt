Thank you for providing this detailed floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan from BAINS 1 to CUISINE.

Room and Door Connections:
- D11: Connects BAINS 1 to HALL 1
- D21: Connects WC 1 to HALL 1
- D31: Connects CHAMBRE 4 to HALL 1
- D41: Connects CHAMBRE 4 to HALL 1
- D51: Connects CHAMBRE 3 to HALL 1
- D61: Connects HALL 1 to PORCHE 1
- D71: Connects PORCHE 1 to CUISINE 1
- D81: Connects CUISINE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE 1
- D91: Connects CELLIER 1 to GARAGE 1

Navigation Plan:
1. Start in BAINS 1
2. ApproachDoor(D11)
3. OpenDoor(D11)
4. GoThrough(D11)
5. ApproachDoor(D61)
6. OpenDoor(D61)
7. GoThrough(D61)
8. ApproachDoor(D71)
9. OpenDoor(D71)
10. GoThrough(D71)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "BAINS 1",
  "end": "CUISINE",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D71"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D71"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D71"}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan provides the most efficient route from BAINS 1 to CUISINE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
