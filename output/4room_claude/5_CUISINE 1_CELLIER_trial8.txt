Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and their door connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan from CUISINE 1 to CELLIER.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CUISINE 1 - D31 (connects to SEJOUR1)
2. SEJOUR1 - D31 (connects to CUISINE 1), D41 (connects to DEGT 1), D11 (connects to Porche1)
3. DEGT 1 - D41 (connects to SEJOUR1), D61 (connects to CH.4), D71 (connects to BAINS 1)
4. Porche1 - D11 (connects to SEJOUR1), D10 (connects to CELLIER)
5. CELLIER - D10 (connects to Porche1)

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in CUISINE 1
2. Use D31 to enter SEJOUR1
3. Use D11 to enter Porche1
4. Use D10 to enter CELLIER (destination)

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D31"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D31"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D31"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D11"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D11"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D11"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D10"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D10"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D10"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from CUISINE 1 to CELLIER, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
