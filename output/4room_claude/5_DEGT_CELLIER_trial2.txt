Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from DEGT to CELLIER.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects Porche to SEJOUR
D2: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
D3: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
D4: Connects SEJOUR to DEGT
D5: Connects DEGT to CH.1
D6: Connects DEGT to CH.2
D7: Connects DEGT to BAINS
D8: Connects DEGT to WC
D9: Connects CH.2 to CH.4
D10: Connects CUISINE to CELLIER

Navigation Plan:
To get from DEGT to CELLIER, we need to go through SEJOUR and CUISINE. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. Start in DEGT
2. Go through D4 to enter SEJOUR
3. Go through D2 or D3 to enter CUISINE (D3 seems slightly closer)
4. Go through D10 to reach CELLIER

Now, I'll provide the detailed action sequence in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "doorNumber": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "doorNumber": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "doorNumber": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "doorNumber": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "doorNumber": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "doorNumber": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "doorNumber": 10
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "doorNumber": 10
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "doorNumber": 10
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from DEGT to CELLIER using only the necessary doors. The robot will start in DEGT, move through SEJOUR and CUISINE, and finally reach CELLIER.
