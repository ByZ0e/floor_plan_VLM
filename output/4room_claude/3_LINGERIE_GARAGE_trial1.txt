Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the connections and create a navigation plan for you to move from the LINGERIE to the GARAGE.

Explicit Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER
D2: Connects PORCHE and CELLIER
D3: Connects PORCHE and HALL
D4: Connects HALL and WC
D5: Connects HALL and LINGERIE
D6: Connects HALL and BUREAU
D7: Connects HALL and BAINS
D8: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE PARENTS
D9: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
D10: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
D11: Connects CELLIER and HALL

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in LINGERIE
2. Use D5 to enter HALL
3. Move through HALL to D11
4. Use D11 to enter CELLIER
5. Use D1 to enter GARAGE

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 11},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently guide you from the LINGERIE to the GARAGE using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
