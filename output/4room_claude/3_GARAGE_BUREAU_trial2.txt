Certainly! I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections based on the floor plan image, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from the GARAGE to the BUREAU.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER
2. D2: Connects CELLIER to PORCHE
3. D3: Connects PORCHE to HALL
4. D4: Connects HALL to WC
5. D5: Connects HALL to LINGERIE
6. D6: Connects HALL to BUREAU
7. D7: Connects HALL to BAINS
8. D8: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE PARENTS
9. D9: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
10. D10: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
11. D11: Connects CELLIER to HALL

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in the GARAGE
2. ApproachDoor(1)
3. OpenDoor(1)
4. GoThrough(1) to enter CELLIER
5. ApproachDoor(11)
6. OpenDoor(11)
7. GoThrough(11) to enter HALL
8. ApproachDoor(6)
9. OpenDoor(6)
10. GoThrough(6) to enter BUREAU

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "GARAGE",
  "end": "BUREAU",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 11},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the GARAGE to the BUREAU, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
