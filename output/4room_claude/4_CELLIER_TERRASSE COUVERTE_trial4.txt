Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the CELLIER to the TERRASSE COUVERTE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D9: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE
2. D1: Connects HALL to BAINS
3. D2: Connects HALL to WC
4. D3: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
5. D4: Connects HALL to another part of HALL
6. D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 2
7. D6: Connects HALL to PORCHE
8. D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE
9. D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
10. D10: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE to TERRASSE COUVERTE (exterior)

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in CELLIER
2. Go through D9 to enter GARAGE
3. Go through D9 again to enter HALL
4. Go through D7 to enter CUISINE
5. Go through D8 to reach TERRASSE COUVERTE

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 9},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 9},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the CELLIER to the TERRASSE COUVERTE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
