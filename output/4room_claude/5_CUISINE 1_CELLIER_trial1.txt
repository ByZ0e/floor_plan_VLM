Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from CUISINE 1 to CELLIER.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D21: Connects CELLIER1 and CUISINE1
2. D31: Connects CUISINE1 and SEJOUR1
3. D10: Connects CELLIER and CELLIER1
4. D2: Connects CELLIER and CUISINE
5. D3: Connects CUISINE and SEJOUR

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CUISINE1
2. Use D21 to go from CUISINE1 to CELLIER1
3. Use D10 to go from CELLIER1 to CELLIER (destination)

Navigation Plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CUISINE1",
  "destination": "CELLIER",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D21"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D21"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D21"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D10"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from CUISINE1 to CELLIER using only the necessary doors. The robot will first move from CUISINE1 to CELLIER1 using door D21, then from CELLIER1 to CELLIER using door D10, reaching the destination.
