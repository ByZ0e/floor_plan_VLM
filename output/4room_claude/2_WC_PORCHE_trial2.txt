Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan based on these connections.

Room and Door Connections:
1. WC connects to DEGT through D8
2. DEGT connects to CH.2 through D6
3. DEGT connects to CH.1 through D5
4. SEJOUR connects to DEGT through D4
5. SEJOUR connects to CUISINE through D3
6. SEJOUR connects to CELLIER through D2
7. SEJOUR connects to PORCHE through D1

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
1. Start in WC
2. ApproachDoor(D8)
3. OpenDoor(D8)
4. GoThrough(D8) to enter DEGT
5. ApproachDoor(D4)
6. OpenDoor(D4)
7. GoThrough(D4) to enter SEJOUR
8. ApproachDoor(D1)
9. OpenDoor(D1)
10. GoThrough(D1) to reach PORCHE

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the WC to the PORCHE using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
