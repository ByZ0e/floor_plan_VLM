Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms, doors, and connections, then provide a navigation plan from the CHAMBRE PARENTS to the GARAGE.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER
D2: Connects PORCHE and CELLIER
D3: Connects PORCHE and HALL
D4: Connects HALL and WC
D5: Connects HALL and LINGERIE
D6: Connects HALL and BUREAU
D7: Connects HALL and BAINS
D8: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE PARENTS
D9: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
D10: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
D11: Connects CELLIER and HALL

Navigation Plan:

Starting from CHAMBRE PARENTS, we need to navigate to the GARAGE. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(8)
2. OpenDoor(8)
3. GoThrough(8)
4. ApproachDoor(11)
5. OpenDoor(11)
6. GoThrough(11)
7. ApproachDoor(1)
8. OpenDoor(1)
9. GoThrough(1)

This plan takes you from the CHAMBRE PARENTS, through the HALL and CELLIER, and finally into the GARAGE.

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 11},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This path is the most efficient route from the CHAMBRE PARENTS to the GARAGE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
