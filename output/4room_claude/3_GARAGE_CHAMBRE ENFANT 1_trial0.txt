Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms, doors, and connections, then provide a navigation plan as requested.

Explicit Room and Door Connections:

D1: Garage <-> Cellier
D2: Cellier <-> Porche
D3: Porche <-> Hall
D4: Hall <-> WC
D5: Hall <-> Lingerie
D6: Hall <-> Bureau
D7: Hall <-> Bains
D8: Hall <-> Chambre Parents
D9: Hall <-> Chambre Enfant 2
D10: Hall <-> Chambre Enfant 1
D11: Cellier <-> Hall

Step-by-step navigation plan:

1. Start in the Garage
2. Use D1 to enter the Cellier
3. Use D11 to enter the Hall
4. Use D10 to enter Chambre Enfant 1

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 11},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 10}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the Garage to Chambre Enfant 1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
