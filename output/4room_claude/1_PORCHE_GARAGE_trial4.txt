Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan from the PORCHE to the GARAGE.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
D2: Connects BAINS to HALL
D3: Connects WC to HALL
D4: Connects CHAMBRE 1 to HALL
D5: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to HALL
D6: Connects PORCHE to HALL
D7: Connects CUISINE to HALL
D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in PORCHE
2. ApproachDoor(D6)
3. OpenDoor(D6)
4. GoThrough(D6) to enter HALL
5. ApproachDoor(D1)
6. OpenDoor(D1)
7. GoThrough(D1) to enter CELLIER
8. ApproachDoor(D9)
9. OpenDoor(D9)
10. GoThrough(D9) to reach GARAGE

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"}
  ]
}
```

This path takes you from the PORCHE to the GARAGE efficiently, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
