Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
D91: Connects CHAMBRE ENFANT 21 to HALL 1
D101: Connects CHAMBRE ENFANT 21 to HALL 1
D81: Connects BAINS1 to HALL 1
D71: Connects BUREAU1 to BAINS1
D61: Connects LINGERIE1 to BUREAU1
D51: Connects WC1 to LINGERIE1
D41: Connects HALL1 to WC1
D31: Connects PORCHE1 to HALL1
D21: Connects CELLIER 1 to PORCHE1
D13: Connects GARAGE1 to CELLIER 1
D111: Connects CELLIER 1 to HALL 1

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CHAMBRE ENFANT 11
2. ApproachDoor(D101)
3. OpenDoor(D101)
4. GoThrough(D101)

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CHAMBRE ENFANT 11",
  "end": "HALL",
  "actions": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D101"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D101"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D101"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from CHAMBRE ENFANT 11 to HALL 1, using only the necessary door (D101) to reach the destination.
