Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the PORCHE to the GARAGE.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
D2: Connects BAINS to HALL
D3: Connects WC to HALL
D4: Connects CHAMBRE 1 to HALL
D5: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to HALL
D6: Connects PORCHE to HALL
D7: Connects CUISINE to HALL
D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE

Navigation Plan:
Starting from the PORCHE, we need to go through the HALL and CELLIER to reach the GARAGE. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(6)
2. OpenDoor(6)
3. GoThrough(6)
4. ApproachDoor(1)
5. OpenDoor(1)
6. GoThrough(1)
7. ApproachDoor(9)
8. OpenDoor(9)
9. GoThrough(9)

Now, let's present this plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "PORCHE",
  "end": "GARAGE",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 9}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the PORCHE to the GARAGE using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
