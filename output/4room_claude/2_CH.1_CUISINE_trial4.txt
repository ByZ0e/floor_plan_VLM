Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms, doors, and their connections, then provide a navigation plan from CH.1 to CUISINE.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

Rooms:
- Porche
- CELLIER
- SEJOUR (multiple instances)
- CUISINE (two instances)
- CH.1 (two instances)
- CH.2 (multiple instances)
- DEGT
- WC
- BAINS

Doors and their connections:
D1: Connects Porche and SEJOUR
D2: Connects CELLIER and CUISINE
D3: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
D5: Connects CH.1 and DEGT
D6: Connects DEGT and CH.2
D7: Connects DEGT and BAINS
D8: Connects DEGT and WC

Now, I'll provide a step-by-step navigation plan from CH.1 to CUISINE:

1. Start in CH.1
2. ApproachDoor(5)
3. OpenDoor(5)
4. GoThrough(5) [Now in DEGT]
5. ApproachDoor(4)
6. OpenDoor(4)
7. GoThrough(4) [Now in SEJOUR]
8. ApproachDoor(3)
9. OpenDoor(3)
10. GoThrough(3) [Now in CUISINE]

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CH.1",
  "end": "CUISINE",
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(5)",
    "OpenDoor(5)",
    "GoThrough(5)",
    "ApproachDoor(4)",
    "OpenDoor(4)",
    "GoThrough(4)",
    "ApproachDoor(3)",
    "OpenDoor(3)",
    "GoThrough(3)"
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan provides the most efficient route from CH.1 to CUISINE using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
