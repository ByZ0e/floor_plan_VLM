Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from CUISINE to CH.2.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects SEJOUR and Porche
D2: Connects CUISINE and SEJOUR
D3: Connects upper CUISINE and lower CUISINE
D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
D5: Connects CH.1 and DEGT
D6: Connects DEGT and CH.2
D7: Connects BAINS and DEGT
D8: Connects WC and DEGT

Now, let's create the navigation plan from CUISINE to CH.2:

1. ApproachDoor(D3)
2. OpenDoor(D3)
3. GoThrough(D3)
4. ApproachDoor(D4)
5. OpenDoor(D4)
6. GoThrough(D4)
7. ApproachDoor(D6)
8. OpenDoor(D6)
9. GoThrough(D6)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"}
  ]
}
```

This path takes you from the CUISINE, through the lower CUISINE, into the SEJOUR, then to the DEGT, and finally into CH.2. It uses only the necessary doors (D3, D4, and D6) to reach the destination efficiently.
