Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the PORCHE to the BAINS.

Rooms and Doors Connections:
1. PORCHE: Connected to SEJOUR via D1
2. CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE via D2
3. SEJOUR: Connected to PORCHE via D1, to CUISINE via D3, to DEGT via D4
4. CUISINE: Connected to CELLIER via D2, to SEJOUR via D3
5. CH. 1: Connected to DEGT via D5
6. DEGT: Connected to SEJOUR via D4, to CH. 1 via D5, to CH. 2 via D6, to BAINS via D7, to WC via D8
7. CH. 2: Connected to DEGT via D6
8. BAINS: Connected to DEGT via D7
9. WC: Connected to DEGT via D8

Navigation Plan:
1. ApproachDoor(D1)
2. OpenDoor(D1)
3. GoThrough(D1)
4. ApproachDoor(D4)
5. OpenDoor(D4)
6. GoThrough(D4)
7. ApproachDoor(D7)
8. OpenDoor(D7)
9. GoThrough(D7)

JSON format of the final path:
```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan will efficiently guide you from the PORCHE to the BAINS using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
