Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from WC 1 to CH.2.

Room and Door Connections:
D31: Connects SEJOUR1 and CUISINE1
D41: Connects SEJOUR1 and DEGT1
D51: Connects DEGT1 and CH.3
D61: Connects DEGT1 and CH.4
D71: Connects DEGT1 and BAINS1
D81: Connects WC1 and DEGT1
D9: Connects left and right sides of the building
D8: Connects DEGT and WC
D7: Connects DEGT and BAINS
D6: Connects DEGT and CH.2
D5: Connects DEGT and CH.1
D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
D3: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
D2: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
D1: Connects SEJOUR and Porche
D10: Connects CELLIER and CELLIER1
D11: Connects Porche1 and SEJOUR1
D21: Connects SEJOUR1 and CUISINE1

Navigation Plan:
Starting from WC1, we need to go through DEGT1, then through the central door D9, and finally into CH.2. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(D81)
2. OpenDoor(D81)
3. GoThrough(D81)
4. ApproachDoor(D9)
5. OpenDoor(D9)
6. GoThrough(D9)
7. ApproachDoor(D6)
8. OpenDoor(D6)
9. GoThrough(D6)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D81"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D81"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D81"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from WC1 to CH.2 using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
