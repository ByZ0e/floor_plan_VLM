Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms and doors, create a list of connections, and then provide a navigation plan from PORCHE to BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects PORCHE to SEJOUR
D2: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
D3: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
D4: Connects SEJOUR to DEGT
D5: Connects DEGT to CH.1
D6: Connects DEGT to CH.2
D7: Connects DEGT to BAINS
D8: Connects DEGT to WC
D9: Connects CH.2 to CH.4 (on the right side)
D10: Connects CELLIER to CUISINE

Based on these connections, here's the efficient navigation plan from PORCHE to BAINS:

1. ApproachDoor(1)
2. OpenDoor(1)
3. GoThrough(1)
4. ApproachDoor(4)
5. OpenDoor(4)
6. GoThrough(4)
7. ApproachDoor(7)
8. OpenDoor(7)
9. GoThrough(7)

Here's the plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from PORCHE to BAINS using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
