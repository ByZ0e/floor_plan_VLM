Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan based on these connections.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects Garage and Cellier
D2: Connects Cellier and Porche
D3: Connects Porche and Hall
D4: Connects Hall and WC
D5: Connects Hall and Lingerie
D6: Connects Hall and Bureau
D7: Connects Hall and Bains
D8: Connects Hall and Chambre Parents
D9: Connects Hall and Chambre Enfant 2
D10: Connects Hall and Chambre Enfant 1
D11: Connects Cellier and Hall

Navigation Plan:
Starting from Chambre Parents to reach Garage

Step 1: Exit Chambre Parents
ApproachDoor(D8)
OpenDoor(D8)
GoThrough(D8)

Step 2: Move through Hall to Cellier
ApproachDoor(D11)
OpenDoor(D11)
GoThrough(D11)

Step 3: Enter Garage from Cellier
ApproachDoor(D1)
OpenDoor(D1)
GoThrough(D1)

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from Chambre Parents to Garage, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
