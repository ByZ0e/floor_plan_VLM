Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the CELLIER to the TERRASSE COUVERTE.

Explicit Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
D2: Connects HALL to BAINS
D3: Connects HALL to WC
D4: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 2
D6: Connects HALL to PORCHE
D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE
D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in CELLIER
2. Use D1 to enter HALL
3. Move through HALL to D7
4. Use D7 to enter CUISINE
5. Use D8 to reach TERRASSE COUVERTE

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the CELLIER to the TERRASSE COUVERTE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
