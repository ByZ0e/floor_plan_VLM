Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the CELLIER to the TERRASSE COUVERTE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D9: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE
2. D1: Connects HALL to BAINS
3. D2: Connects HALL to WC
4. D3: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
5. D4: Connects HALL to HALL (different sections)
6. D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 2
7. D6: Connects HALL to PORCHE
8. D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE
9. D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
10. D10: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE to TERRASSE COUVERTE (outdoor area)

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in CELLIER
2. ApproachDoor(D9)
3. OpenDoor(D9)
4. GoThrough(D9) to enter GARAGE
5. ApproachDoor(D9)
6. OpenDoor(D9)
7. GoThrough(D9) to enter CELLIER
8. ApproachDoor(D1)
9. OpenDoor(D1)
10. GoThrough(D1) to enter HALL
11. ApproachDoor(D7)
12. OpenDoor(D7)
13. GoThrough(D7) to enter CUISINE
14. ApproachDoor(D8)
15. OpenDoor(D8)
16. GoThrough(D8) to reach TERRASSE COUVERTE

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CELLIER",
  "end": "TERRASSE COUVERTE",
  "actions": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the CELLIER to the TERRASSE COUVERTE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
