Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the WC to the PORCHE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. WC: Connected to DEGT via D8
2. DEGT: Connected to WC via D8, CH.2 via D7, SEJOUR via D4, CH.1 via D5
3. CH.2: Connected to DEGT via D7
4. CH.1: Connected to DEGT via D5, SEJOUR via D4
5. SEJOUR: Connected to DEGT via D4, CH.1 via D4, CUISINE via D3
6. CUISINE: Connected to SEJOUR via D3, CELLIER via D2
7. CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE via D2
8. PORCHE: Connected to SEJOUR via D1

Navigation Plan:
To go from the WC to the PORCHE, we need to follow these steps:
1. Exit WC to DEGT
2. Go from DEGT to SEJOUR
3. Go from SEJOUR to PORCHE

Here's the detailed action plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 8
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 8
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 8
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the WC to the PORCHE using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
