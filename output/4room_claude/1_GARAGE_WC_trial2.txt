Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the GARAGE to the WC.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D9: Connects CELLIER and GARAGE
2. D1: Connects CELLIER and HALL
3. D2: Connects HALL and BAINS
4. D3: Connects HALL and WC
5. D4: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 1
6. D5: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 2
7. D6: Connects HALL and PORCHE
8. D7: Connects HALL and CUISINE
9. D8: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE

Navigation Plan:
To go from the GARAGE to the WC, we need to use the following doors: D9, D1, and D3.

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in GARAGE
2. Use D9 to enter CELLIER
3. Use D1 to enter HALL
4. Use D3 to enter WC

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 9
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 9
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 9
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 3
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from the GARAGE to the WC, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
