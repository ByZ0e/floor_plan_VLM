Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and their door connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from DEGT to CELLIER.

Room and Door Connections:
1. DEGT: Connected to SEJOUR via D8, to CH.1 via D6
2. SEJOUR: Connected to DEGT via D8, to CUISINE via D3, to Porche via D1
3. CUISINE: Connected to SEJOUR via D3, to CELLIER via D2
4. CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE via D2
5. Porche: Connected to SEJOUR via D1
6. CH.1: Connected to DEGT via D6
7. CH.2: Connected to DEGT via D5
8. BAINS: Connected to DEGT via D7

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in DEGT
2. ApproachDoor(D8)
3. OpenDoor(D8)
4. GoThrough(D8) - Now in SEJOUR
5. ApproachDoor(D3)
6. OpenDoor(D3)
7. GoThrough(D3) - Now in CUISINE
8. ApproachDoor(D2)
9. OpenDoor(D2)
10. GoThrough(D2) - Now in CELLIER (destination reached)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan provides the most efficient route from DEGT to CELLIER using only the necessary doors and rooms.
