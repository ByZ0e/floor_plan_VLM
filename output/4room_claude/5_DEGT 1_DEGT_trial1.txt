Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from DEGT 1 to DEGT.

Room and Door Connections:

1. DEGT 1 connects to SEJOUR 1 via door D51
2. SEJOUR 1 connects to CUISINE 1 via door D31
3. CUISINE 1 connects to CELLIER 1 via door D21
4. CELLIER 1 connects to CELLIER via door D10
5. CELLIER connects to CUISINE via door D2
6. CUISINE connects to SEJOUR via door D3
7. SEJOUR connects to DEGT via door D8

Navigation Plan:

To get from DEGT 1 to DEGT, we need to follow this path:
DEGT 1 -> SEJOUR 1 -> CUISINE 1 -> CELLIER 1 -> CELLIER -> CUISINE -> SEJOUR -> DEGT

Here's the step-by-step navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D51"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D51"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D51"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D31"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D31"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D31"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D21"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D21"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D21"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan will efficiently guide you from DEGT 1 to DEGT using only the necessary doors and rooms along the path.
