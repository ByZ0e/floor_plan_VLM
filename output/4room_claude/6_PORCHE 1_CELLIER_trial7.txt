Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the connections and provide a navigation plan as requested.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D21: Connects PORCHE1 to HALL1
D31: Connects PORCHE1 to CELLIER1
D13: Connects GARAGE1 to CELLIER1
D111: Connects CELLIER1 to HALL1

Navigation Plan:

Starting from PORCHE1, we need to reach CELLIER1. The most efficient path is to use door D31, which directly connects PORCHE1 to CELLIER1.

Here's the step-by-step navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D31"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D31"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D31"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates you from PORCHE1 to CELLIER1 using the most direct route available. The plan avoids unnecessary doors and rooms, ensuring a straightforward path to your destination.
