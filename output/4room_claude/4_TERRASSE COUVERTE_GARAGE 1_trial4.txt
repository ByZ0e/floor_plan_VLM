Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
D10: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE to TERRASSE COUVERTE 1
D81: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE 1 to CUISINE 1
D71: Connects CUISINE 1 to HALL 1
D61: Connects HALL 1 to PORCHE 1
D51: Connects HALL 1 to CHAMBRE 3
D41: Connects HALL 1 to CHAMBRE 4
D21: Connects HALL 1 to WC 1
D11: Connects HALL 1 to CELLIER 1
D91: Connects CELLIER 1 to GARAGE 1

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in TERRASSE COUVERTE
2. Use D10 to enter TERRASSE COUVERTE 1
3. Use D81 to enter CUISINE 1
4. Use D71 to enter HALL 1
5. Use D11 to enter CELLIER 1
6. Use D91 to reach GARAGE 1

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D81"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D81"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D81"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D71"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D71"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D71"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D91"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D91"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D91"}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan provides the most efficient path from TERRASSE COUVERTE to GARAGE 1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
