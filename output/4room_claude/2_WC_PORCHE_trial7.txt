Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the WC to the PORCHE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects SEJOUR to PORCHE
2. D2: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
3. D3: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
4. D4: Connects SEJOUR to DEGT
5. D5: Connects CH.1 to DEGT
6. D6: Connects CH.2 to DEGT
7. D7: Connects BAINS to DEGT
8. D8: Connects WC to DEGT

Navigation Plan:
Starting from the WC, we need to traverse through DEGT, SEJOUR, and finally reach PORCHE. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(8)
2. OpenDoor(8)
3. GoThrough(8)
4. ApproachDoor(1)
5. OpenDoor(1)
6. GoThrough(1)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the WC to the PORCHE using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
