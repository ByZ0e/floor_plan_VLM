Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from DEGT to CELLIER.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects Porche and SEJOUR
2. D2: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
3. D3: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
4. D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
5. D5: Connects DEGT and CH.1
6. D6: Connects DEGT and CH.2
7. D7: Connects DEGT and BAINS
8. D8: Connects DEGT and WC
9. D9: Connects CH.2 and CH.4
10. D10: Connects CUISINE and CELLIER

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in DEGT
2. ApproachDoor(D3)
3. OpenDoor(D3)
4. GoThrough(D3)
5. ApproachDoor(D2)
6. OpenDoor(D2)
7. GoThrough(D2)
8. ApproachDoor(D10)
9. OpenDoor(D10)
10. GoThrough(D10)

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "DEGT",
  "end": "CELLIER",
  "actions": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D10"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from DEGT to CELLIER using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
