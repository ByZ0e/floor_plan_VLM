Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. Let's start by listing the relevant rooms and doors with their connections, then create a navigation plan based on this information.

Relevant Room and Door Connections:
- PORCHE1 <-> D21 <-> CELLIER 1
- CELLIER 1 <-> D13 <-> GARAGE 1
- CELLIER 1 <-> D111 <-> HALL 1

Now, let's create the navigation plan to go from PORCHE1 to CELLIER:

1. ApproachDoor(D21)
2. OpenDoor(D21)
3. GoThrough(D21)

This simple sequence of actions will take you from PORCHE1 directly to CELLIER 1, which is the most efficient path based on the floor plan provided.

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "PORCHE1",
  "end": "CELLIER",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D21"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D21"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D21"}
  ]
}
```

This plan ensures that you navigate from PORCHE1 to CELLIER using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
