Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll first list the relevant rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Relevant Room and Door Connections:
- PORCHE1 connects to HALL1 via D31
- HALL1 connects to CELLIER 1 via D111

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
1. Start in PORCHE1
2. ApproachDoor(D31)
3. OpenDoor(D31)
4. GoThrough(D31) to enter HALL1
5. ApproachDoor(D111)
6. OpenDoor(D111)
7. GoThrough(D111) to enter CELLIER 1

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "PORCHE1",
  "end": "CELLIER 1",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D31"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D31"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D31"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D111"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D111"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D111"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides an efficient route from PORCHE1 to CELLIER 1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
