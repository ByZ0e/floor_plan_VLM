Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from CHAMBRE PARENTS to GARAGE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D8 connects CHAMBRE PARENTS and HALL
2. D7 connects HALL and BAINS
3. D6 connects HALL and BUREAU
4. D5 connects HALL and LINGERIE
5. D4 connects HALL and WC
6. D3 connects HALL and PORCHE
7. D2 connects PORCHE and CELLIER
8. D1 connects CELLIER and GARAGE
9. D9 connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
10. D10 connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
11. D11 connects HALL and CELLIER

Navigation Plan:
1. ApproachDoor(D8)
2. OpenDoor(D8)
3. GoThrough(D8)
4. ApproachDoor(D5)
5. OpenDoor(D5)
6. GoThrough(D5)
7. ApproachDoor(D11)
8. OpenDoor(D11)
9. GoThrough(D11)
10. ApproachDoor(D1)
11. OpenDoor(D1)
12. GoThrough(D1)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CHAMBRE PARENTS to GARAGE using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
