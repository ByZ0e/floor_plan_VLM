Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from DEGT to CELLIER.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects Porche to SEJOUR
2. D2: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
3. D3: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
4. D4: Connects SEJOUR to DEGT
5. D5: Connects DEGT to CH.1
6. D6: Connects DEGT to CH.2
7. D7: Connects DEGT to BAINS
8. D8: Connects DEGT to WC
9. D9: Connects CH.2 to CH.4
10. D10: Connects CUISINE to CELLIER

Navigation Plan:
To go from DEGT to CELLIER, we need to follow these steps:

1. ApproachDoor(D4)
2. OpenDoor(D4)
3. GoThrough(D4)
4. ApproachDoor(D3)
5. OpenDoor(D3)
6. GoThrough(D3)
7. ApproachDoor(D10)
8. OpenDoor(D10)
9. GoThrough(D10)

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "DEGT",
  "end": "CELLIER",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D10"}
  ]
}
```

This plan takes you from DEGT through SEJOUR and CUISINE to reach CELLIER efficiently, using only the necessary doors along the path.
