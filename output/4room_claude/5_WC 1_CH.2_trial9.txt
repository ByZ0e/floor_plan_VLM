Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from WC 1 to CH.2.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D71 connects BAINS 1 and DEGT 1
2. D61 connects DEGT 1 and CH.4
3. D51 connects DEGT 1 and SEJOUR 1
4. D41 connects SEJOUR 1 and CH.3
5. D31 connects SEJOUR 1 and CUISINE 1
6. D21 connects CUISINE 1 and CELLIER 1
7. D11 connects SEJOUR 1 and Porche 1
8. D10 connects CELLIER and CUISINE
9. D9 connects CH.2 and CH.4
10. D8 connects DEGT and BAINS
11. D7 connects DEGT and CH.2
12. D6 connects DEGT and CH.1
13. D5 connects DEGT and SEJOUR
14. D4 connects SEJOUR and CH.1
15. D3 connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
16. D2 connects CUISINE and CELLIER
17. D1 connects SEJOUR and Porche

Navigation Plan from WC 1 to CH.2:
1. ApproachDoor(D71)
2. OpenDoor(D71)
3. GoThrough(D71)
4. ApproachDoor(D7)
5. OpenDoor(D7)
6. GoThrough(D7)

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D71"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D71"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D71"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from WC 1 to CH.2 using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
