Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the room and door connections, then provide a navigation plan from DEGT to CELLIER.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects SEJOUR and Porche
D2: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
D3: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
D5: Connects DEGT and CH.1
D6: Connects DEGT and CH.2
D7: Connects DEGT and BAINS
D8: Connects DEGT and WC

To navigate from DEGT to CELLIER, we need to go through SEJOUR. Here's the step-by-step navigation plan:

1. ApproachDoor(4)
2. OpenDoor(4)
3. GoThrough(4)
4. ApproachDoor(1)
5. OpenDoor(1)
6. GoThrough(1)

Now, here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "DEGT",
  "end": "CELLIER",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from DEGT to CELLIER using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
