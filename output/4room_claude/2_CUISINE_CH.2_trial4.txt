Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the CUISINE to CH.2.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects SEJOUR and Porche
D2: Connects CUISINE and CELLIER
D3: Connects CUISINE and SEJOUR
D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
D5: Connects CH.1 and DEGT
D6: Connects CH.2 and DEGT
D7: Connects BAINS and DEGT
D8: Connects WC and DEGT

Now, let's create the navigation plan from CUISINE to CH.2:

1. Start in CUISINE
2. Use D3 to enter SEJOUR
3. Use D4 to enter DEGT
4. Use D6 to enter CH.2

Here's the step-by-step navigation plan:

1. ApproachDoor(3)
2. OpenDoor(3)
3. GoThrough(3)
4. ApproachDoor(4)
5. OpenDoor(4)
6. GoThrough(4)
7. ApproachDoor(6)
8. OpenDoor(6)
9. GoThrough(6)

Now, I'll provide the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CUISINE",
  "end": "CH.2",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan provides the most efficient route from the CUISINE to CH.2, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
