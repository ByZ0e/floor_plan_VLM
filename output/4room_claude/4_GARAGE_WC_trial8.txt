Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the GARAGE to the WC.

Room and Door Connections:
D9: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER
D1: Connects CELLIER and HALL
D2: Connects HALL and BAINS/WC
D3: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 1
D4: Connects HALL and HALL
D5: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 2
D6: Connects HALL and PORCHE
D7: Connects PORCHE and CUISINE
D8: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
D10: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE and TERRASSE COUVERTE

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in GARAGE
2. Use D9 to enter CELLIER
3. Use D1 to enter HALL
4. Use D2 to reach WC

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from the GARAGE to the WC, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
