Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and their door connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from CUISINE 1 to CELLIER.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CUISINE 1 - D31 (connects to SEJOUR1)
2. SEJOUR1 - D31 (connects to CUISINE 1), D41 (connects to DEGT 1), D11 (connects to Porche1)
3. DEGT 1 - D41 (connects to SEJOUR1), D61 (connects to CH.4), D71 (connects to BAINS 1)
4. Porche1 - D11 (connects to SEJOUR1), D10 (connects to CELLIER)
5. CELLIER - D10 (connects to Porche1)

Navigation Plan:
To go from CUISINE 1 to CELLIER, we need to follow this path:
CUISINE 1 -> SEJOUR1 -> Porche1 -> CELLIER

Here's the step-by-step navigation plan:

1. ApproachDoor(31)
2. OpenDoor(31)
3. GoThrough(31)
4. ApproachDoor(11)
5. OpenDoor(11)
6. GoThrough(11)
7. ApproachDoor(10)
8. OpenDoor(10)
9. GoThrough(10)

Now, I'll provide the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CUISINE 1",
  "end": "CELLIER",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 31},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 31},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 31},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 11},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 10}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan will efficiently guide you from CUISINE 1 to CELLIER using only the necessary doors and rooms.
