Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from BAINS 1 to CUISINE.

Room and Door Connections:

D11: Connects BAINS 1 and HALL1
D21: Connects WC 1 and HALL1
D31: Connects CHAMBRE 4 and HALL1
D41: Connects CHAMBRE 4 and HALL1
D51: Connects CHAMBRE 3 and HALL1
D61: Connects HALL1 and PORCHE 1
D71: Connects CUISINE1 and HALL1
D81: Connects CUISINE1 and TERRASSE COUVERTE 1
D91: Connects CELLIER1 and GARAGE1

Navigation Plan:

To go from BAINS 1 to CUISINE, we need to use the following doors: D11 and D71.

Here's the step-by-step navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D11"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D11"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D11"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D71"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D71"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D71"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently guide you from BAINS 1 to CUISINE using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
