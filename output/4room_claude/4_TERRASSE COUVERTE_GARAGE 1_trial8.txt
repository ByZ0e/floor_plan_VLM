Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to GARAGE 1.

Room and Door Connections:

1. D10 connects TERRASSE COUVERTE to TERRASSE COUVERTE 1
2. D81 connects TERRASSE COUVERTE 1 to CUISINE 1
3. D71 connects CUISINE 1 to HALL 1
4. D61 connects HALL 1 to PORCHE 1
5. D51 connects HALL 1 to CHAMBRE 3
6. D11 connects HALL 1 to BAINS 1
7. D21 connects BAINS 1 to WC 1
8. D31 connects HALL 1 to CHAMBRE 4
9. D41 connects HALL 1 to HALL 1 (different section)
10. D91 connects CELLIER 1 to GARAGE 1

Navigation Plan:

1. ApproachDoor(D10)
2. OpenDoor(D10)
3. GoThrough(D10)
4. ApproachDoor(D81)
5. OpenDoor(D81)
6. GoThrough(D81)
7. ApproachDoor(D71)
8. OpenDoor(D71)
9. GoThrough(D71)
10. ApproachDoor(D91)
11. OpenDoor(D91)
12. GoThrough(D91)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D81"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D81"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D81"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D71"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D71"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D71"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D91"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D91"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D91"}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan will efficiently guide you from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to GARAGE 1 using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
