Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from PORCHE to BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects PORCHE and SEJOUR
2. D2: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
3. D3: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
4. D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
5. D5: Connects DEGT and CH.1
6. D6: Connects DEGT and CH.2
7. D7: Connects DEGT and BAINS
8. D8: Connects DEGT and WC
9. D9: Connects CH.2 and CH.4
10. D10: Connects CELLIER and CUISINE

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in PORCHE
2. ApproachDoor(D1)
3. OpenDoor(D1)
4. GoThrough(D1) to enter SEJOUR
5. ApproachDoor(D4)
6. OpenDoor(D4)
7. GoThrough(D4) to enter DEGT
8. ApproachDoor(D7)
9. OpenDoor(D7)
10. GoThrough(D7) to enter BAINS

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct route from PORCHE to BAINS using only the necessary doors.
