Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll first list the relevant rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Relevant Room and Door Connections:
- CHAMBRE ENFANT 11 connects to HALL 1 via door D101
- HALL 1 connects to HALL 1 (central area) via door D51

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in CHAMBRE ENFANT 11
2. Approach door D101
3. Open door D101
4. Go through door D101 to enter HALL 1
5. Approach door D51
6. Open door D51
7. Go through door D51 to enter the main HALL 1 area

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D101"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D101"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D101"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D51"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D51"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D51"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CHAMBRE ENFANT 11 to the main HALL area using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
