Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from PORCHE 1 to CELLIER.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D21 connects PORCHE1 to CELLIER 1
2. D31 connects PORCHE1 to HALL1
3. D41 connects HALL1 to WC1
4. D51 connects HALL1 to LINGERIE1
5. D61 connects HALL1 to BUREAU1
6. D71 connects HALL1 to BAINS1
7. D81 connects HALL1 to CHAMBRE PARENTS1
8. D91 connects HALL1 to CHAMBRE ENFANT 21
9. D101 connects HALL1 to CHAMBRE ENFANT 11
10. D111 connects CELLIER 1 to HALL1
11. D13 connects GARAGE1 to CELLIER 1

Navigation Plan:
To go from PORCHE1 to CELLIER:

1. ApproachDoor(D21)
2. OpenDoor(D21)
3. GoThrough(D21)

This is the most direct and efficient path from PORCHE1 to CELLIER. Here's the plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "PORCHE1",
  "end": "CELLIER",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D21"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D21"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D21"}
  ]
}
```

This plan takes you directly from PORCHE1 to CELLIER using the door D21, which connects these two rooms. It's the most efficient route as it doesn't involve going through any unnecessary rooms or doors.
