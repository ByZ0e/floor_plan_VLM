Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from DEGT to CELLIER.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects SEJOUR and Porche
- D2: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
- D3: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
- D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
- D5: Connects DEGT and CH.1
- D6: Connects DEGT and CH.2
- D7: Connects DEGT and BAINS
- D8: Connects DEGT and WC

To navigate from DEGT to CELLIER, we need to use the following path:
DEGT -> SEJOUR -> CUISINE -> CELLIER

Here's the step-by-step navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the DEGT to the CELLIER using only the necessary doors. The plan takes into account that doors close after each GoThrough action, so we need to open each door before passing through it.
