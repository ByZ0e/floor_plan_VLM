Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from DEGT to CELLIER.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects SEJOUR and Porche
2. D2: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
3. D3: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
4. D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
5. D5: Connects DEGT and CH.1
6. D6: Connects DEGT and CH.2
7. D7: Connects DEGT and BAINS
8. D8: Connects DEGT and WC

Navigation Plan:
To get from DEGT to CELLIER, we need to go through the SEJOUR. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(4)
2. OpenDoor(4)
3. GoThrough(4)
4. ApproachDoor(1)
5. OpenDoor(1)
6. GoThrough(1)

Here's the plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "DEGT",
  "end": "CELLIER",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan takes you from DEGT through SEJOUR and finally to CELLIER using the most direct route available based on the floor plan provided.
