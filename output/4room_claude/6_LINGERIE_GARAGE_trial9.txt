Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms, doors, and their connections, then provide a navigation plan from the LINGERIE to the GARAGE.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE
D2: Connects PORCHE to GARAGE
D3: Connects PORCHE to HALL
D4: Connects HALL to WC
D5: Connects LINGERIE to HALL
D6: Connects BUREAU to HALL
D7: Connects BAINS to HALL
D8: Connects CHAMBRE PARENTS to HALL
D9: Connects CHAMBRE ENFANT 2 to HALL
D10: Connects CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 to HALL
D11: Connects CELLIER to HALL
D12: Connects upper HALL to lower HALL

Step-by-step navigation plan:

1. Start in LINGERIE
2. Use D5 to enter HALL
3. Use D11 to enter CELLIER
4. Use D1 to enter GARAGE

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "LINGERIE",
  "end": "GARAGE",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 11},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the LINGERIE to the GARAGE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
