Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from DEGT 1 to DEGT.

Room and Door Connections:
D31: Connects SEJOUR1 and CUISINE1
D41: Connects SEJOUR1 and DEGT1
D51: Connects DEGT1 and CH.3
D61: Connects DEGT1 and CH.4
D71: Connects DEGT1 and BAINS1
D9: Connects CH.2 and CH.4
D8: Connects DEGT and BAINS
D7: Connects DEGT and CH.2
D6: Connects DEGT and CH.1
D5: Connects DEGT and CH.1
D4: Connects DEGT and SEJOUR
D3: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
D2: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
D1: Connects SEJOUR and Porche
D10: Connects CELLIER and CUISINE

Navigation Plan:
To go from DEGT1 to DEGT, we need to use the following doors: D41, D31, D3, and D4.

Here's the step-by-step navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D41"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D41"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D41"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D31"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D31"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D31"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from DEGT1 to DEGT using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
