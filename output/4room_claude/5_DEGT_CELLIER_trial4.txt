Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from DEGT to CELLIER.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects Porche to SEJOUR
D2: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
D3: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
D4: Connects SEJOUR to DEGT
D5: Connects DEGT to CH.1
D6: Connects DEGT to CH.2
D7: Connects DEGT to BAINS
D8: Connects DEGT to WC
D9: Connects CH.2 to CH.4
D10: Connects CUISINE to CELLIER
D11: Connects Porche1 to SEJOUR1
D21: Connects SEJOUR1 to CUISINE1
D31: Connects SEJOUR1 to CUISINE1
D41: Connects SEJOUR1 to DEGT1
D51: Connects DEGT1 to CH.3
D61: Connects DEGT1 to CH.4
D71: Connects DEGT1 to BAINS1
D81: Connects DEGT1 to WC1

Step-by-step navigation plan:

1. Start in DEGT
2. ApproachDoor(D4)
3. OpenDoor(D4)
4. GoThrough(D4)
5. ApproachDoor(D3)
6. OpenDoor(D3)
7. GoThrough(D3)
8. ApproachDoor(D10)
9. OpenDoor(D10)
10. GoThrough(D10)

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D10"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from DEGT to CELLIER using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
