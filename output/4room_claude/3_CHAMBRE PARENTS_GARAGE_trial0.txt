Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the CHAMBRE PARENTS to the GARAGE.

Room and Door Connections:
- D8: Connects CHAMBRE PARENTS to HALL
- D7: Connects HALL to BAINS
- D6: Connects HALL to BUREAU
- D5: Connects HALL to LINGERIE
- D4: Connects HALL to WC
- D3: Connects HALL to PORCHE
- D2: Connects PORCHE to CELLIER
- D1: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE
- D9: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
- D10: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
- D11: Connects HALL to CELLIER

Navigation Plan:
1. Start in CHAMBRE PARENTS
2. ApproachDoor(8)
3. OpenDoor(8)
4. GoThrough(8) to enter HALL
5. ApproachDoor(11)
6. OpenDoor(11)
7. GoThrough(11) to enter CELLIER
8. ApproachDoor(1)
9. OpenDoor(1)
10. GoThrough(1) to enter GARAGE

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 11},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This path takes you from the CHAMBRE PARENTS to the GARAGE using the most direct route available based on the door connections provided in the floor plan.
