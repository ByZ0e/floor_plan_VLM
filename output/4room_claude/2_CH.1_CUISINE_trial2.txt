Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from CH.1 to CUISINE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects SEJOUR to PORCHE
2. D2: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
3. D3: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
4. D4: Connects SEJOUR to DEGT
5. D5: Connects CH.1 to DEGT
6. D6: Connects DEGT to CH.2
7. D7: Connects DEGT to BAINS
8. D8: Connects DEGT to WC

Step-by-step solution:
1. Starting in CH.1, we need to go through DEGT to reach SEJOUR, and then to CUISINE.
2. From CH.1, we'll use D5 to enter DEGT.
3. From DEGT, we'll use D4 to enter SEJOUR.
4. From SEJOUR, we can use either D2 or D3 to reach CUISINE. We'll choose D2 for this plan.

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently guide you from CH.1 to CUISINE using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
