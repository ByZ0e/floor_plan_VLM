Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the relevant rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from PORCHE 1 to CELLIER.

Relevant Room and Door Connections:
- PORCHE1 <-> D21 <-> CELLIER 1
- CELLIER 1 <-> D13 <-> GARAGE 1

Navigation Plan:

1. Start in PORCHE1
2. ApproachDoor(D21)
3. OpenDoor(D21)
4. GoThrough(D21)

This sequence will take you directly from PORCHE1 to CELLIER 1, which is labeled as CELLIER in the floor plan.

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "PORCHE1",
  "end": "CELLIER",
  "steps": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D21"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D21"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D21"}
  ]
}
```

This is the most efficient path from PORCHE1 to CELLIER, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or actions.
