Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll first list the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects Cellier and Hall
D2: Connects Bains and Hall
D3: Connects WC and Hall
D4: Connects Chambre 1 and Hall
D5: Connects Chambre 2 and Hall
D6: Connects Porche and Hall
D7: Connects Cuisine and Hall
D8: Connects Cuisine and Terrasse Couverte
D9: Connects Cellier and Garage

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in the Garage
2. Approach and open D9 to enter Cellier
3. Approach and open D1 to enter Hall
4. Approach and open D3 to reach WC

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 9},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the Garage to the WC, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
