Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the connections and provide a navigation plan as requested.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects Garage and Cellier
D2: Connects Porche and Cellier
D3: Connects Porche and Hall
D4: Connects Hall and WC
D5: Connects Hall and Lingerie
D6: Connects Hall and Bureau
D7: Connects Hall and Bains
D8: Connects Hall and Chambre Parents
D9: Connects Hall and Chambre Enfant 2
D10: Connects Hall and Chambre Enfant 1
D11: Connects Cellier and Hall

Step-by-step navigation plan:

1. Start in Lingerie
2. Use D5 to enter Hall
3. Use D11 to enter Cellier
4. Use D1 to enter Garage

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 11},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the Lingerie to the Garage, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
