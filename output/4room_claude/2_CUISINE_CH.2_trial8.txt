Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the CUISINE to CH.2.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects SEJOUR to Porche
2. D2 connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
3. D3 connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
4. D4 connects SEJOUR to DEGT
5. D5 connects CH.1 to DEGT
6. D6 connects CH.2 to DEGT
7. D7 connects BAINS to DEGT
8. D8 connects WC to DEGT

Now, let's create a step-by-step navigation plan from CUISINE to CH.2:

1. Start in CUISINE
2. ApproachDoor(D3)
3. OpenDoor(D3)
4. GoThrough(D3) - Now in SEJOUR
5. ApproachDoor(D4)
6. OpenDoor(D4)
7. GoThrough(D4) - Now in DEGT
8. ApproachDoor(D6)
9. OpenDoor(D6)
10. GoThrough(D6) - Now in CH.2

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from CUISINE to CH.2, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
