Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
1. DEGT connects to SEJOUR via D4
2. DEGT connects to CH.2 via D6
3. DEGT connects to BAINS via D7
4. SEJOUR connects to CUISINE via D3
5. SEJOUR connects to Porche via D1
6. CUISINE connects to CELLIER via D2
7. CH.1 connects to SEJOUR via D5
8. BAINS connects to WC via D8

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
1. Start in DEGT
2. ApproachDoor(D6)
3. OpenDoor(D6)
4. GoThrough(D6) - Now in CH.2
5. ApproachDoor(D6)
6. OpenDoor(D6)
7. GoThrough(D6) - Back in DEGT
8. ApproachDoor(D4)
9. OpenDoor(D4)
10. GoThrough(D4) - Now in SEJOUR
11. ApproachDoor(D3)
12. OpenDoor(D3)
13. GoThrough(D3) - Now in CUISINE
14. ApproachDoor(D2)
15. OpenDoor(D2)
16. GoThrough(D2) - Now in CELLIER (destination reached)

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from DEGT to CELLIER using only the necessary doors and rooms.
