Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the relevant rooms and doors, and then provide a navigation plan from the LINGERIE to the GARAGE.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D4: Connects LINGERIE to HALL
D5: Connects HALL to BUREAU
D6: Connects HALL to BUREAU
D7: Connects HALL to BAINS
D8: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE PARENTS
D9: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
D10: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
D11: Connects HALL to CELLIER
D1: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE
D2: Connects CELLIER to PORCHE
D3: Connects PORCHE to HALL
D12: Connects HALL to HALL (between upper and lower sections)

Step-by-step navigation plan:

1. Start in LINGERIE
2. Use D4 to enter HALL
3. Move through HALL to reach D11
4. Use D11 to enter CELLIER
5. Use D1 to reach GARAGE

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 11},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the LINGERIE to the GARAGE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
