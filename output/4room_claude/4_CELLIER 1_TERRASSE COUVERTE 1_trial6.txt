Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a detailed navigation plan for you to move from CELLIER 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE 1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D91 connects CELLIER 1 and GARAGE 1
2. D11 connects CELLIER 1 and HALL 1
3. D21 connects HALL 1 and WC 1
4. D31 connects HALL 1 and CHAMBRE 4
5. D41 connects HALL 1 and HALL 1 (different sections)
6. D51 connects HALL 1 and CHAMBRE 3
7. D61 connects HALL 1 and PORCHE 1
8. D71 connects PORCHE 1 and CUISINE 1
9. D81 connects CUISINE 1 and TERRASSE COUVERTE 1

Navigation Plan:
To move from CELLIER 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE 1, we'll use the following sequence of actions:

1. ApproachDoor(D11)
2. OpenDoor(D11)
3. GoThrough(D11)
4. ApproachDoor(D41)
5. OpenDoor(D41)
6. GoThrough(D41)
7. ApproachDoor(D61)
8. OpenDoor(D61)
9. GoThrough(D61)
10. ApproachDoor(D71)
11. OpenDoor(D71)
12. GoThrough(D71)
13. ApproachDoor(D81)
14. OpenDoor(D81)
15. GoThrough(D81)

This sequence will take you from CELLIER 1 through HALL 1, PORCHE 1, and CUISINE 1 to finally reach TERRASSE COUVERTE 1.

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D41"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D41"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D41"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D71"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D71"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D71"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D81"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D81"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D81"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from CELLIER 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE 1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
