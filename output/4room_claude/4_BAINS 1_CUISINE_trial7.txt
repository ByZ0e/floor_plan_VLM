Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D11 connects BAINS 1 and Hall 1
2. D21 connects WC 1 and Hall 1
3. D31 connects CHAMBRE 4 and Hall 1
4. D41 connects CHAMBRE 4 and Hall 1
5. D51 connects CHAMBRE 3 and Hall 1
6. D61 connects Hall 1 and PORCHE 1
7. D71 connects PORCHE 1 and CUISINE 1
8. D81 connects CUISINE 1 and TERRASSE COUVERTE 1
9. D91 connects CELLIER 1 and GARAGE 1

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in BAINS 1
2. Use D11 to enter Hall 1
3. Use D61 to enter PORCHE 1
4. Use D71 to enter CUISINE 1

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D71"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D71"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D71"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from BAINS 1 to CUISINE 1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
