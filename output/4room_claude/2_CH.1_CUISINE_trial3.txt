Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from CH.1 to CUISINE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects SEJOUR to PORCHE
2. D2 connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
3. D3 connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
4. D4 connects SEJOUR to DEGT
5. D5 connects CH.1 to DEGT
6. D6 connects DEGT to CH.2
7. D7 connects DEGT to BAINS
8. D8 connects DEGT to WC

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CH.1
2. Use D5 to enter DEGT
3. Use D4 to enter SEJOUR
4. Use D2 or D3 to enter CUISINE

Based on this analysis, here's the efficient navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 5
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 5
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 5
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 2
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 2
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 2
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from CH.1 to CUISINE using the necessary doors. The robot will start in CH.1, go through DEGT and SEJOUR, and finally reach CUISINE.
