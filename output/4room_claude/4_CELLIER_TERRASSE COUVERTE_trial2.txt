Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and their door connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the CELLIER to the TERRASSE COUVERTE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CELLIER - D9 connects to GARAGE
2. CELLIER - D1 connects to HALL
3. BAINS - D2 connects to HALL
4. WC - D3 connects to HALL
5. CHAMBRE 1 - D4 connects to HALL
6. CHAMBRE 2 - D5 connects to HALL
7. PORCHE - D6 connects to HALL
8. CUISINE - D7 connects to HALL
9. CUISINE - D8 connects to TERRASSE COUVERTE
10. TERRASSE COUVERTE - D10 connects to TERRASSE COUVERTE

Navigation Plan:
To get from CELLIER to TERRASSE COUVERTE, we need to go through the following sequence:
CELLIER -> HALL -> CUISINE -> TERRASSE COUVERTE

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CELLIER
2. Use D1 to enter HALL
3. Use D7 to enter CUISINE
4. Use D8 to reach TERRASSE COUVERTE

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the CELLIER to the TERRASSE COUVERTE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
