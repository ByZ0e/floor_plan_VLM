Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan from the PORCHE to the GARAGE.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects CELLIER and HALL
D2: Connects BAINS and HALL
D3: Connects WC and HALL
D4: Connects CHAMBRE 1 and HALL
D5: Connects CHAMBRE 2 and HALL
D6: Connects PORCHE and HALL
D7: Connects CUISINE and HALL
D8: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Connects CELLIER and GARAGE

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in PORCHE
2. ApproachDoor(D6)
3. OpenDoor(D6)
4. GoThrough(D6) to enter HALL
5. ApproachDoor(D1)
6. OpenDoor(D1)
7. GoThrough(D1) to enter CELLIER
8. ApproachDoor(D9)
9. OpenDoor(D9)
10. GoThrough(D9) to enter GARAGE

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the PORCHE to the GARAGE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
