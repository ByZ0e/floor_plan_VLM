Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from WC 1 to CH.2.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D31 connects CUISINE1 and SEJOUR1
2. D41 connects SEJOUR1 and DEGT1
3. D51 connects DEGT1 and CH.3
4. D61 connects DEGT1 and CH.4
5. D71 connects DEGT1 and BAINS1
6. D81 connects DEGT1 and WC1
7. D9 connects CH.2 and CH.4
8. D8 connects DEGT and WC
9. D7 connects DEGT and BAINS
10. D6 connects DEGT and CH.1
11. D5 connects DEGT and CH.1
12. D4 connects SEJOUR and DEGT
13. D3 connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
14. D2 connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
15. D1 connects SEJOUR and Porche
16. D10 connects CELLIER and CUISINE
17. D11 connects Porche1 and SEJOUR1
18. D21 connects CELLIER1 and CUISINE1

Navigation Plan:
To go from WC1 to CH.2, we need to follow these steps:

1. ApproachDoor(D81)
2. OpenDoor(D81)
3. GoThrough(D81)
4. ApproachDoor(D61)
5. OpenDoor(D61)
6. GoThrough(D61)
7. ApproachDoor(D9)
8. OpenDoor(D9)
9. GoThrough(D9)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D81"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D81"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D81"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"}
  ]
}
```

This path takes you from WC1 through DEGT1, then to CH.4, and finally to CH.2, using only the necessary doors to reach the destination.
