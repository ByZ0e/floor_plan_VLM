Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects Garage to Cellier
2. D2: Connects Cellier to Porche
3. D3: Connects Porche to Hall
4. D4: Connects Hall to WC
5. D5: Connects Hall to Lingerie
6. D6: Connects Hall to Bureau
7. D7: Connects Hall to Bains
8. D8: Connects Hall to Chambre Parents
9. D9: Connects Hall to Chambre Enfant 2
10. D10: Connects Hall to Chambre Enfant 1
11. D11: Connects Cellier to Hall

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in the Garage
2. ApproachDoor(1)
3. OpenDoor(1)
4. GoThrough(1) to enter Cellier
5. ApproachDoor(11)
6. OpenDoor(11)
7. GoThrough(11) to enter Hall
8. ApproachDoor(10)
9. OpenDoor(10)
10. GoThrough(10) to enter Chambre Enfant 1

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "doorNumber": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "doorNumber": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "doorNumber": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "doorNumber": 11},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "doorNumber": 11},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "doorNumber": 11},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "doorNumber": 10},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "doorNumber": 10},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "doorNumber": 10}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from the Garage to Chambre Enfant 1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
