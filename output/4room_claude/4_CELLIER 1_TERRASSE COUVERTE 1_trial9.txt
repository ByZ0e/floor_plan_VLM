Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from CELLIER 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE 1.

Room and Door Connections:
- D91: Connects CELLIER 1 and HALL 1
- D11: Connects HALL 1 and BAINS 1
- D21: Connects HALL 1 and WC 1
- D31: Connects HALL 1 and CHAMBRE 4
- D41: Connects HALL 1 and HALL 1 (different sections)
- D51: Connects HALL 1 and CHAMBRE 3
- D61: Connects HALL 1 and PORCHE 1
- D71: Connects PORCHE 1 and CUISINE 1
- D81: Connects CUISINE 1 and TERRASSE COUVERTE 1

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in CELLIER 1
2. Use D91 to enter HALL 1
3. Cross HALL 1 to reach PORCHE 1 via D61
4. From PORCHE 1, enter CUISINE 1 through D71
5. Finally, go from CUISINE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE 1 using D81

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D91"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D91"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D91"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D71"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D71"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D71"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D81"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D81"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D81"}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan provides the most direct and efficient route from CELLIER 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE 1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
