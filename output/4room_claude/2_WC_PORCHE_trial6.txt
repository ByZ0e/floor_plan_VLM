Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. Let me first list out the rooms and doors with their connections based on the image:

Room and Door Connections:
1. WC connects to DEGT through D8
2. DEGT connects to CH.2 through D6
3. DEGT connects to CH.1 through D5
4. DEGT connects to SEJOUR through D4
5. SEJOUR connects to CUISINE through D3
6. SEJOUR connects to another part of SEJOUR through D1
7. CUISINE connects to CELLIER through D2
8. The larger SEJOUR area connects to PORCHE (no door between them)

Now, let's create a step-by-step navigation plan to go from WC to PORCHE:

1. Start in WC
2. ApproachDoor(8)
3. OpenDoor(8)
4. GoThrough(8) - Now in DEGT
5. ApproachDoor(4)
6. OpenDoor(4)
7. GoThrough(4) - Now in SEJOUR
8. Move through SEJOUR to reach PORCHE (no door needed)

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from WC to PORCHE using only the necessary doors. After going through door D4, you'll be in the SEJOUR area, which directly connects to PORCHE without any additional doors.
