Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from CH.1 to CUISINE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects SEJOUR and PORCHE
2. D2 connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
3. D3 connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
4. D4 connects SEJOUR and DEGT
5. D5 connects CH.1 and DEGT
6. D6 connects DEGT and CH.2
7. D7 connects DEGT and BAINS
8. D8 connects DEGT and WC

Navigation Plan:
To get from CH.1 to CUISINE, we need to use doors D5 and D3. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(5)
2. OpenDoor(5)
3. GoThrough(5)
4. ApproachDoor(3)
5. OpenDoor(3)
6. GoThrough(3)

Now, I'll provide the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CH.1",
  "end": "CUISINE",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CH.1 to CUISINE using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
