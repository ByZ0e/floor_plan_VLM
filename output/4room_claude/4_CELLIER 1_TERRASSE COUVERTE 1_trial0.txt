Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan from CELLIER 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE 1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D91: Connects CELLIER 1 and HALL 1
2. D11: Connects HALL 1 and BAINS 1
3. D21: Connects HALL 1 and WC 1
4. D31: Connects HALL 1 and CHAMBRE 4
5. D41: Connects HALL 1 and HALL 1 (different sections)
6. D51: Connects HALL 1 and CHAMBRE 3
7. D61: Connects HALL 1 and PORCHE 1
8. D71: Connects HALL 1 and CUISINE 1
9. D81: Connects CUISINE 1 and TERRASSE COUVERTE 1

Navigation Plan:
To go from CELLIER 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE 1, we need to follow these steps:

1. Start in CELLIER 1
2. Use D91 to enter HALL 1
3. Move through HALL 1 to reach D71
4. Use D71 to enter CUISINE 1
5. Use D81 to reach TERRASSE COUVERTE 1

Here's the detailed action plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D91"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D91"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D91"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D71"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D71"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D71"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D81"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D81"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D81"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from CELLIER 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE 1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
