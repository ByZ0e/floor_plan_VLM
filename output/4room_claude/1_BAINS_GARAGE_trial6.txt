Thank you for providing the floor plan image and the navigation task. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a detailed navigation plan from the BAINS to the GARAGE.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects CELLIER and HALL
D2: Connects BAINS and HALL
D3: Connects WC and HALL
D4: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 1
D5: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 2
D6: Connects HALL and PORCHE
D7: Connects HALL and CUISINE
D8: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Connects CELLIER and GARAGE

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in BAINS
2. Use D2 to enter HALL
3. Use D1 to enter CELLIER
4. Use D9 to reach GARAGE

Now, I'll provide the detailed navigation plan in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 9}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan provides the most efficient path from the BAINS to the GARAGE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
