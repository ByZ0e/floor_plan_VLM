Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from DEGT to CELLIER.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects Porche and SEJOUR
D2: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
D3: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
D5: Connects DEGT and CH.1
D6: Connects DEGT and CH.2
D7: Connects DEGT and BAINS
D8: Connects DEGT and WC
D9: Connects CH.2 and CH.4 (of the adjacent unit)
D10: Connects CUISINE and CELLIER

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in DEGT
2. Approach and open door D4
3. Go through D4 to enter SEJOUR
4. Approach and open door D2 or D3 (D3 is slightly closer)
5. Go through D3 to enter CUISINE
6. Approach and open door D10
7. Go through D10 to reach CELLIER

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D10"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from DEGT to CELLIER using only the necessary doors and rooms. The robot will start in DEGT, move through SEJOUR and CUISINE, and finally reach CELLIER.
