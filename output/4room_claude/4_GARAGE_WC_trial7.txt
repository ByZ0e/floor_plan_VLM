Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the room and door connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the GARAGE to the WC.

Room and Door Connections:
D9: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER
D1: Connects HALL and CELLIER
D2: Connects HALL and BAINS/WC area
D3: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 1
D4: Connects HALL areas
D5: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 2
D6: Connects HALL and PORCHE
D7: Connects HALL and CUISINE
D8: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
D10: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE areas

Navigation Plan:
To go from the GARAGE to the WC, we need to use the following sequence of actions:

1. ApproachDoor(9)
2. OpenDoor(9)
3. GoThrough(9)
4. ApproachDoor(1)
5. OpenDoor(1)
6. GoThrough(1)
7. ApproachDoor(2)
8. OpenDoor(2)
9. GoThrough(2)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 9},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2}
  ]
}
```

This path takes you from the GARAGE through the CELLIER, then through the HALL, and finally into the BAINS/WC area where the WC is located. Each door is approached, opened, and gone through in the correct sequence to reach the destination efficiently.
