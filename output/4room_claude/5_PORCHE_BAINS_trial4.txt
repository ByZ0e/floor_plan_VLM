Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms and doors, create a list of connections, and then provide a navigation plan from PORCHE to BAINS.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects PORCHE to SEJOUR
D2: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
D3: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
D4: Connects SEJOUR to DEGT
D5: Connects DEGT to CH.1
D6: Connects DEGT to CH.2
D7: Connects DEGT to BAINS
D8: Connects DEGT to WC
D9: Connects CH.2 to CH.4 (on the right side)
D10: Connects CELLIER to PORCHE1 (top center)

Navigation Plan:

To go from PORCHE to BAINS, we need to use the following sequence of actions:

1. ApproachDoor(1)
2. OpenDoor(1)
3. GoThrough(1)
4. ApproachDoor(4)
5. OpenDoor(4)
6. GoThrough(4)
7. ApproachDoor(7)
8. OpenDoor(7)
9. GoThrough(7)

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "PORCHE",
  "end": "BAINS",
  "actions": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from PORCHE to BAINS using only the necessary doors. The robot will start in PORCHE, move through SEJOUR, then DEGT, and finally reach BAINS.
