Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the CUISINE to CH.2.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects SEJOUR and PORCHE
2. D2 connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
3. D3 connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
4. D4 connects SEJOUR and DEGT
5. D5 connects CH.1 and DEGT
6. D6 connects CH.2 and DEGT
7. D7 connects BAINS and DEGT
8. D8 connects WC and DEGT

Now, let's create the navigation plan from CUISINE to CH.2:

1. ApproachDoor(3)
2. OpenDoor(3)
3. GoThrough(3)
4. ApproachDoor(4)
5. OpenDoor(4)
6. GoThrough(4)
7. ApproachDoor(6)
8. OpenDoor(6)
9. GoThrough(6)

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CUISINE",
  "end": "CH.2",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from CUISINE to CH.2, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
