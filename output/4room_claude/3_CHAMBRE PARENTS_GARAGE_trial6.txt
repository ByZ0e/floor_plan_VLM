Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms, doors, and their connections, then provide a detailed navigation plan from the CHAMBRE PARENTS to the GARAGE.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D8: Connects CHAMBRE PARENTS to HALL
D7: Connects HALL to BAINS
D6: Connects HALL to BUREAU
D5: Connects HALL to LINGERIE
D4: Connects HALL to WC
D3: Connects HALL to PORCHE
D2: Connects PORCHE to CELLIER
D1: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE
D9: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2 (not needed for this route)
D10: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 (not needed for this route)
D11: Connects CELLIER to HALL (not needed for this route)

Step-by-step navigation plan:

1. Start in CHAMBRE PARENTS
2. ApproachDoor(D8)
3. OpenDoor(D8)
4. GoThrough(D8) to enter HALL
5. ApproachDoor(D3)
6. OpenDoor(D3)
7. GoThrough(D3) to enter PORCHE
8. ApproachDoor(D2)
9. OpenDoor(D2)
10. GoThrough(D2) to enter CELLIER
11. ApproachDoor(D1)
12. OpenDoor(D1)
13. GoThrough(D1) to enter GARAGE

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CHAMBRE PARENTS",
  "end": "GARAGE",
  "actions": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from CHAMBRE PARENTS to GARAGE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
