Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the relevant rooms and door connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from CELLIER 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE 1.

Relevant Room and Door Connections:
- CELLIER 1 <-> D91 <-> GARAGE 1
- GARAGE 1 <-> D91 <-> CELLIER 1
- CELLIER 1 <-> D11 <-> HALL 1
- HALL 1 <-> D51 <-> CHAMBRE 3
- HALL 1 <-> D61 <-> PORCHE 1
- PORCHE 1 <-> D71 <-> CUISINE 1
- CUISINE 1 <-> D81 <-> TERRASSE COUVERTE 1

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
1. Start in CELLIER 1
2. Use D11 to enter HALL 1
3. Cross HALL 1 to D61
4. Use D61 to enter PORCHE 1
5. Use D71 to enter CUISINE 1
6. Use D81 to reach TERRASSE COUVERTE 1

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D71"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D71"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D71"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D81"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D81"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D81"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from CELLIER 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE 1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
