Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from CUISINE 1 to CELLIER.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D21: Connects CELLIER1 and CUISINE1
2. D31: Connects CUISINE1 and SEJOUR1
3. D10: Connects CELLIER and CUISINE
4. D2: Connects CUISINE and SEJOUR
3. D3: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE

Navigation Plan:

To go from CUISINE 1 to CELLIER, we need to traverse through SEJOUR1, SEJOUR, and CUISINE. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. Start in CUISINE 1
2. Use D31 to enter SEJOUR1
3. Use D41 to enter SEJOUR
4. Use D3 to enter CUISINE
5. Use D10 to reach CELLIER

Now, I'll provide the detailed action sequence in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D31"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D31"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D31"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D41"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D41"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D41"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D10"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from CUISINE 1 to CELLIER based on the provided floor plan, using only the necessary doors and rooms for traversal.
