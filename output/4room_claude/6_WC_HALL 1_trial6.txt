Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll analyze the image, list the room and door connections, and then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER
D2: Connects GARAGE and PORCHE
D3: Connects PORCHE and HALL
D4: Connects HALL and WC
D5: Connects HALL and LINGERIE
D6: Connects HALL and BUREAU
D7: Connects HALL and BAINS
D8: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE PARENTS
D9: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
D10: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
D11: Connects CELLIER and HALL
D12: Connects HALL (upper) and HALL (lower)

Now, let's create the navigation plan to go from WC to HALL 1:

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in WC
2. Use D4 to enter HALL
3. We are now in HALL 1, which is our destination

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the WC to HALL 1 using only the necessary doors. The robot will approach and go through door D4, which directly connects the WC to the HALL area, thus reaching the destination HALL 1.
