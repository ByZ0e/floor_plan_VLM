Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
D2: Connects BAINS to HALL
D3: Connects WC to HALL
D4: Connects CHAMBRE 1 to HALL
D5: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to HALL
D6: Connects PORCHE to HALL
D7: Connects CUISINE to HALL
D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE

Navigation Plan:
Starting from the GARAGE, we need to reach the WC. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(D9)
2. OpenDoor(D9)
3. GoThrough(D9)
4. ApproachDoor(D1)
5. OpenDoor(D1)
6. GoThrough(D1)
7. ApproachDoor(D3)
8. OpenDoor(D3)
9. GoThrough(D3)

Now, let's present this plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the GARAGE to the WC using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors. The robot will start in the GARAGE, go through the CELLIER, enter the HALL, and finally reach the WC.
