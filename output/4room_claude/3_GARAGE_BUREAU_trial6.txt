Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the GARAGE to the BUREAU.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER
D2: Connects CELLIER to PORCHE
D3: Connects PORCHE to HALL
D4: Connects HALL to WC
D5: Connects HALL to LINGERIE
D6: Connects HALL to BUREAU
D7: Connects HALL to BAINS
D8: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE PARENTS
D9: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
D10: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
D11: Connects CELLIER to HALL

Navigation Plan:
1. ApproachDoor(1)
2. OpenDoor(1)
3. GoThrough(1)
4. ApproachDoor(11)
5. OpenDoor(11)
6. GoThrough(11)
7. ApproachDoor(6)
8. OpenDoor(6)
9. GoThrough(6)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 11},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan provides the most efficient route from the GARAGE to the BUREAU, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
