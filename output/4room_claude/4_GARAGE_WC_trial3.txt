Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the GARAGE to the WC.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects HALL to BAINS
D2: Connects HALL to WC
D3: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
D4: Connects HALL to HALL (different sections)
D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 2
D6: Connects HALL to PORCHE
D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE
D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE
D10: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE to TERRASSE COUVERTE (exterior)

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in GARAGE
2. Use D9 to enter CELLIER
3. Go through CELLIER to reach HALL
4. In HALL, approach D2
5. Open and go through D2 to reach WC

Based on this analysis, here's the efficient navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 9},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct route from the GARAGE to the WC, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
