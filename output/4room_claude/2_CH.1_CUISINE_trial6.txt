Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll first list the room and door connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from CH.1 to CUISINE.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects SEJOUR to PORCHE
D2: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
D3: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
D4: Connects SEJOUR to DEGT
D5: Connects CH.1 to DEGT
D6: Connects DEGT to CH.2
D7: Connects DEGT to BAINS
D8: Connects DEGT to WC

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in CH.1
2. Approach and open door D5 to enter DEGT
3. From DEGT, approach and open door D4 to enter SEJOUR
4. In SEJOUR, approach and open door D3 to enter CUISINE

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from CH.1 to CUISINE using only the necessary doors. The robot will start in CH.1, go through DEGT and SEJOUR, and finally arrive at CUISINE.
