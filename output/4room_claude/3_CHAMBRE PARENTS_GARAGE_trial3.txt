Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D8: Connects Chambre Parents to Hall
2. D7: Connects Hall to Bains
3. D6: Connects Hall to Bureau
4. D5: Connects Hall to Lingerie
5. D4: Connects Hall to WC
6. D3: Connects Hall to Porche
7. D2: Connects Porche to Cellier
8. D1: Connects Cellier to Garage

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in Chambre Parents
2. ApproachDoor(D8)
3. OpenDoor(D8)
4. GoThrough(D8) to enter Hall
5. ApproachDoor(D3)
6. OpenDoor(D3)
7. GoThrough(D3) to enter Porche
8. ApproachDoor(D2)
9. OpenDoor(D2)
10. GoThrough(D2) to enter Cellier
11. ApproachDoor(D1)
12. OpenDoor(D1)
13. GoThrough(D1) to enter Garage

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from Chambre Parents to Garage, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
