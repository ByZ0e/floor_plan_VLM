Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms, doors, and their connections, then provide a navigation plan from CH.1 to CUISINE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CH.1 connects to SEJOUR through D5
2. SEJOUR connects to DEGT through D4
3. DEGT connects to CH.2 through D6
4. DEGT connects to CUISINE through D3
5. SEJOUR connects to CUISINE through D1 and D2

Navigation Plan:
To go from CH.1 to CUISINE, we'll use the following path: CH.1 -> SEJOUR -> DEGT -> CUISINE

Here's the detailed step-by-step plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CH.1 to CUISINE using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors. The robot will start in CH.1, move through SEJOUR and DEGT, and finally arrive at CUISINE.
