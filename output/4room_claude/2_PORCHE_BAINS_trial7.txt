Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan from PORCHE to BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
1. PORCHE connects to SEJOUR via D1
2. SEJOUR connects to CUISINE via D2 and D3
3. SEJOUR connects to CH.1 via D4
4. CH.1 connects to DEGT via D5
5. CH.2 connects to DEGT via D6
6. DEGT connects to BAINS via D7
7. DEGT connects to WC via D8

Navigation Plan:
To go from PORCHE to BAINS, we need to follow this path: PORCHE -> SEJOUR -> CH.1 -> DEGT -> BAINS

Here's the detailed step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(1)
2. OpenDoor(1)
3. GoThrough(1)
4. ApproachDoor(4)
5. OpenDoor(4)
6. GoThrough(4)
7. ApproachDoor(5)
8. OpenDoor(5)
9. GoThrough(5)
10. ApproachDoor(7)
11. OpenDoor(7)
12. GoThrough(7)

Now, I'll provide the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7}
  ]
}
```

This path efficiently navigates from PORCHE to BAINS using only the necessary doors and rooms.
