Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll first list out the relevant rooms and door connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Relevant Room and Door Connections:
- WC connects to Hall via D4
- Hall connects to Lingerie via D5
- Lingerie connects to Hall 1 via D51

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
1. Start in WC
2. ApproachDoor(D4)
3. OpenDoor(D4)
4. GoThrough(D4) to enter Hall
5. ApproachDoor(D5)
6. OpenDoor(D5)
7. GoThrough(D5) to enter Lingerie
8. ApproachDoor(D51)
9. OpenDoor(D51)
10. GoThrough(D51) to enter Hall 1

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D51"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D51"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D51"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the WC to Hall 1 using only the necessary doors and rooms.
