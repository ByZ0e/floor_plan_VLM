Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll analyze the connections and provide a detailed navigation plan as requested.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:
D91: Connects CHAMBRE ENFANT 21 to HALL 1
D101: Connects CHAMBRE ENFANT 21 to HALL 1
D81: Connects CHAMBRE PARENTS1 to HALL 1
D71: Connects BAINS1 to HALL 1
D61: Connects BUREAU1 to HALL 1
D51: Connects LINGERIE1 to HALL 1
D41: Connects WC1 to HALL1
D31: Connects PORCHE1 to HALL1
D21: Connects PORCHE1 to CELLIER 1
D13: Connects GARAGE1 to CELLIER 1
D111: Connects CELLIER 1 to HALL 1

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CHAMBRE ENFANT 11
2. ApproachDoor(D101)
3. OpenDoor(D101)
4. GoThrough(D101)

This sequence will take you directly from CHAMBRE ENFANT 11 to HALL 1, which is the destination.

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CHAMBRE ENFANT 11",
  "end": "HALL",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D101"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D101"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D101"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the starting point to the destination, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary steps or rooms.
