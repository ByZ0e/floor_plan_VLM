Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. Let me first list out the rooms and doors with their connections based on the image, and then I'll provide the navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
- WC: Connected to DEGT via D8
- DEGT: Connected to WC via D8, CH.2 via D6, CH.1 via D5, SEJOUR via D4
- CH.2: Connected to DEGT via D6
- CH.1: Connected to DEGT via D5
- SEJOUR: Connected to DEGT via D4, CUISINE via D3
- CUISINE: Connected to SEJOUR via D3, CELLIER via D2
- CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE via D2
- PORCHE: Connected to SEJOUR via D1

Now, let's create the navigation plan from WC to PORCHE:

1. ApproachDoor(8)
2. OpenDoor(8)
3. GoThrough(8)
4. ApproachDoor(4)
5. OpenDoor(4)
6. GoThrough(4)
7. ApproachDoor(1)
8. OpenDoor(1)
9. GoThrough(1)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This path takes you from the WC through the DEGT and SEJOUR to reach the PORCHE, using only the necessary doors along the way. The plan avoids any unnecessary rooms or doors, providing an efficient route to your destination.
