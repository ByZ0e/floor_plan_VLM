Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from CELLIER 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE 1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D91 connects CELLIER 1 and GARAGE 1
2. D11 connects CELLIER 1 and HALL 1
3. D21 connects HALL 1 and WC 1
4. D31 connects HALL 1 and CHAMBRE 4
5. D41 connects HALL 1 and HALL 1 (different sections)
6. D51 connects HALL 1 and CHAMBRE 3
7. D61 connects HALL 1 and PORCHE 1
8. D71 connects PORCHE 1 and CUISINE 1
9. D81 connects CUISINE 1 and TERRASSE COUVERTE 1

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in CELLIER 1
2. Use D11 to enter HALL 1
3. Use D41 to move through HALL 1
4. Use D61 to enter PORCHE 1
5. Use D71 to enter CUISINE 1
6. Use D81 to reach TERRASSE COUVERTE 1

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D41"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D41"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D41"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D71"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D71"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D71"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D81"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D81"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D81"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from CELLIER 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE 1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
