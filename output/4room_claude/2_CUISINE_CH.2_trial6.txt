Thank you for providing the floor plan image. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from CUISINE to CH.2.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects SEJOUR and Porche
2. D2 connects CUISINE and CELLIER
3. D3 connects CUISINE and SEJOUR
4. D4 connects SEJOUR and DEGT
5. D5 connects CH.1 and DEGT
6. D6 connects CH.2 and DEGT
7. D7 connects BAINS and DEGT
8. D8 connects WC and DEGT

Navigation Plan:
To go from CUISINE to CH.2, we need to use doors D3, D4, and D6. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. Start in CUISINE
2. ApproachDoor(3)
3. OpenDoor(3)
4. GoThrough(3) - Now in SEJOUR
5. ApproachDoor(4)
6. OpenDoor(4)
7. GoThrough(4) - Now in DEGT
8. ApproachDoor(6)
9. OpenDoor(6)
10. GoThrough(6) - Now in CH.2

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(3)",
    "OpenDoor(3)",
    "GoThrough(3)",
    "ApproachDoor(4)",
    "OpenDoor(4)",
    "GoThrough(4)",
    "ApproachDoor(6)",
    "OpenDoor(6)",
    "GoThrough(6)"
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from CUISINE to CH.2, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
