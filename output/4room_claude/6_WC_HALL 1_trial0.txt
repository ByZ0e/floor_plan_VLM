Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the connections and create a navigation plan for you to move from the WC to HALL 1. Let's start by listing the relevant rooms and doors:

Room and Door Connections:
1. WC connects to HALL via D4
2. HALL connects to LINGERIE via D5
3. LINGERIE connects to HALL 1 via D51

Now, let's create the step-by-step navigation plan:

1. Start in WC
2. ApproachDoor(D4)
3. OpenDoor(D4)
4. GoThrough(D4) to enter HALL
5. ApproachDoor(D5)
6. OpenDoor(D5)
7. GoThrough(D5) to enter LINGERIE
8. ApproachDoor(D51)
9. OpenDoor(D51)
10. GoThrough(D51) to enter HALL 1

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "WC",
  "end": "HALL 1",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D51"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D51"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D51"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently guide you from the WC to HALL 1 using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
