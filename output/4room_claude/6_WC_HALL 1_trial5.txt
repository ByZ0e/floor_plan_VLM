Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the WC to HALL 1.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER
D2: Connects GARAGE and PORCHE
D3: Connects PORCHE and HALL
D4: Connects HALL and WC
D5: Connects HALL and LINGERIE
D6: Connects HALL and BUREAU
D7: Connects HALL and BAINS
D8: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE PARENTS
D9: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
D10: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
D11: Connects CELLIER and HALL
D12: Connects HALL 1 and PORCHE1
D21: Connects GARAGE1 and PORCHE1
D31: Connects PORCHE1 and HALL1
D41: Connects HALL1 and WC1
D51: Connects HALL1 and LINGERIE1
D61: Connects HALL1 and BUREAU1
D71: Connects HALL1 and BAINS1
D81: Connects HALL1 and CHAMBRE PARENTS1
D91: Connects HALL1 and CHAMBRE ENFANT 21
D101: Connects HALL1 and CHAMBRE ENFANT 11
D111: Connects CELLIER 1 and HALL1
D13: Connects GARAGE1 and CELLIER 1

Now, I'll provide the step-by-step navigation plan from WC to HALL 1:

1. ApproachDoor(D41)
2. OpenDoor(D41)
3. GoThrough(D41)

This plan will take you directly from the WC to HALL 1, which is the destination.

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D41"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D41"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D41"}
  ]
}
```

This is the most efficient and correct path from WC to HALL 1 based on the provided floor plan.
