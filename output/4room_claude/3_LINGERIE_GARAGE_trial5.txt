Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from the LINGERIE to the GARAGE.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER
D2: Connects CELLIER and PORCHE
D3: Connects PORCHE and HALL
D4: Connects HALL and WC
D5: Connects LINGERIE and HALL
D6: Connects BUREAU and HALL
D7: Connects BAINS and HALL
D8: Connects CHAMBRE PARENTS and HALL
D9: Connects CHAMBRE ENFANT 2 and HALL
D10: Connects CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 and HALL
D11: Connects CELLIER and HALL

Navigation Plan:
1. Start in LINGERIE
2. ApproachDoor(D5)
3. OpenDoor(D5)
4. GoThrough(D5)
5. ApproachDoor(D11)
6. OpenDoor(D11)
7. GoThrough(D11)
8. ApproachDoor(D1)
9. OpenDoor(D1)
10. GoThrough(D1)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "LINGERIE",
  "end": "GARAGE",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"}
  ]
}
```

This path takes you from the LINGERIE through the HALL and CELLIER to reach the GARAGE, using only the necessary doors along the way.
