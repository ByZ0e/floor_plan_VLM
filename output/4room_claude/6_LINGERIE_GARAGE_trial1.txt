Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the LINGERIE to the GARAGE.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER
D2: Connects GARAGE and PORCHE
D3: Connects PORCHE and HALL
D4: Connects HALL and WC
D5: Connects HALL and LINGERIE
D6: Connects HALL and BUREAU
D7: Connects HALL and BAINS
D8: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE PARENTS
D9: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
D10: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
D11: Connects CELLIER and HALL
D12: Connects HALL (upper) and PORCHE (upper)

Now, I'll provide a step-by-step navigation plan from LINGERIE to GARAGE:

1. Start in LINGERIE
2. ApproachDoor(5)
3. OpenDoor(5)
4. GoThrough(5)
5. ApproachDoor(11)
6. OpenDoor(11)
7. GoThrough(11)
8. ApproachDoor(1)
9. OpenDoor(1)
10. GoThrough(1)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "LINGERIE",
  "end": "GARAGE",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 11},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This path takes you from LINGERIE through the HALL and CELLIER to reach the GARAGE efficiently, using only the necessary doors.
