Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from CELLIER 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE 1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D91: Connects CELLIER1 and GARAGE1
2. D11: Connects CELLIER1 and HALL1
3. D21: Connects HALL1 and WC1/BAINS1
4. D31: Connects HALL1 and CHAMBRE4
5. D41: Connects HALL1 and HALL1 (different sections)
6. D51: Connects HALL1 and CHAMBRE3
7. D61: Connects HALL1 and PORCHE1
8. D71: Connects HALL1 and CUISINE1
9. D81: Connects CUISINE1 and TERRASSE COUVERTE1

Navigation Plan:
To go from CELLIER1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE1, we need to follow these steps:

1. ApproachDoor(D11)
2. OpenDoor(D11)
3. GoThrough(D11)
4. ApproachDoor(D41)
5. OpenDoor(D41)
6. GoThrough(D41)
7. ApproachDoor(D71)
8. OpenDoor(D71)
9. GoThrough(D71)
10. ApproachDoor(D81)
11. OpenDoor(D81)
12. GoThrough(D81)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D41"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D41"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D41"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D71"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D71"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D71"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D81"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D81"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D81"}
  ]
}
```

This path takes you from CELLIER1 through the necessary doors to reach TERRASSE COUVERTE1 efficiently, avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
