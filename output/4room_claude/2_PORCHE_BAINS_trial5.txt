Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll first list the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
1. Porche: Connected to Sejour via D1
2. Cellier: Connected to Cuisine via D2
3. Sejour: Connected to Porche via D1, to Cuisine via D3, to CH.1 via D4
4. Cuisine: Connected to Cellier via D2, to Sejour via D3
5. CH.1: Connected to Sejour via D4, to DEGT via D5
6. DEGT: Connected to CH.1 via D5, to CH.2 via D6, to WC via D8, to BAINS via D7
7. CH.2: Connected to DEGT via D6
8. WC: Connected to DEGT via D8
9. BAINS: Connected to DEGT via D7

Now, I'll provide the step-by-step navigation plan to go from PORCHE to BAINS:

1. ApproachDoor(1)
2. OpenDoor(1)
3. GoThrough(1)
4. ApproachDoor(4)
5. OpenDoor(4)
6. GoThrough(4)
7. ApproachDoor(5)
8. OpenDoor(5)
9. GoThrough(5)
10. ApproachDoor(7)
11. OpenDoor(7)
12. GoThrough(7)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7}
  ]
}
```

This path takes you from PORCHE to SEJOUR, then to CH.1, through DEGT, and finally to BAINS, using only the necessary doors along the way.
