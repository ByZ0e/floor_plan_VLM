Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from CH.1 to CUISINE.

Rooms and Doors Connections:
1. CH.1 connects to SEJOUR through D5
2. SEJOUR connects to CUISINE through D3
3. SEJOUR connects to DEGT through D4
4. CH.1 connects to CH.2 through D6
5. DEGT connects to CH.2 through D6
6. DEGT connects to BAINS through D7
7. DEGT connects to WC through D8
8. SEJOUR connects to Porche through D1
9. CUISINE connects to CELLIER through D2

Now, let's create a step-by-step navigation plan from CH.1 to CUISINE:

1. ApproachDoor(5)
2. OpenDoor(5)
3. GoThrough(5)
4. ApproachDoor(3)
5. OpenDoor(3)
6. GoThrough(3)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CH.1",
  "end": "CUISINE",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan will efficiently guide you from CH.1 to CUISINE using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
