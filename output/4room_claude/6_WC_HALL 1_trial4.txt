Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the connections and provide a navigation plan as requested.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D2: Connects CELLIER and PORCHE
D3: Connects PORCHE and HALL
D4: Connects HALL and WC
D5: Connects HALL and LINGERIE
D6: Connects HALL and BUREAU
D7: Connects HALL and BAINS
D8: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE PARENTS
D9: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
D10: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
D11: Connects CELLIER and HALL
D12: Connects HALL 1 and PORCHE1
D13: Connects GARAGE1 and CELLIER 1
D21: Connects CELLIER 1 and PORCHE1
D31: Connects PORCHE1 and HALL1
D41: Connects HALL1 and WC1
D51: Connects HALL1 and LINGERIE1
D61: Connects HALL1 and BUREAU1
D71: Connects HALL1 and BAINS1
D81: Connects HALL1 and CHAMBRE PARENTS1
D91: Connects HALL1 and CHAMBRE ENFANT 21
D101: Connects HALL1 and CHAMBRE ENFANT 11
D111: Connects CELLIER 1 and HALL 1

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in WC1
2. Use D41 to enter HALL1

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 41},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 41},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 41}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the WC1 to HALL1 using only the necessary door.
