Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the CHAMBRE PARENTS to the GARAGE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D8: Connects CHAMBRE PARENTS to HALL
2. D7: Connects HALL to BAINS
3. D6: Connects HALL to BUREAU
4. D5: Connects HALL to LINGERIE
5. D4: Connects HALL to WC
6. D3: Connects HALL to PORCHE
7. D2: Connects PORCHE to CELLIER
8. D1: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE
9. D9: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
10. D10: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
11. D11: Connects HALL to CELLIER

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in CHAMBRE PARENTS
2. ApproachDoor(D8)
3. OpenDoor(D8)
4. GoThrough(D8) to enter HALL
5. ApproachDoor(D5)
6. OpenDoor(D5)
7. GoThrough(D5) to enter LINGERIE
8. ApproachDoor(D3)
9. OpenDoor(D3)
10. GoThrough(D3) to enter PORCHE
11. ApproachDoor(D2)
12. OpenDoor(D2)
13. GoThrough(D2) to enter CELLIER
14. ApproachDoor(D1)
15. OpenDoor(D1)
16. GoThrough(D1) to enter GARAGE

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from CHAMBRE PARENTS to GARAGE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
