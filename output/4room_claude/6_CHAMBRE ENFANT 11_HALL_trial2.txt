Thank you for providing the floor plan image and the navigation task. I'll first list the relevant room and door connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan, and finally present the path in JSON format.

Relevant Room and Door Connections:
- CHAMBRE ENFANT 11 connects to HALL 1 via door D101
- HALL 1 connects to HALL 1 (central area) via door D51

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
1. Start in CHAMBRE ENFANT 11
2. ApproachDoor(D101)
3. OpenDoor(D101)
4. GoThrough(D101) to enter HALL 1
5. ApproachDoor(D51)
6. OpenDoor(D51)
7. GoThrough(D51) to enter the central HALL 1 area

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CHAMBRE ENFANT 11",
  "end": "HALL",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D101"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D101"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D101"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D51"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D51"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D51"}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan will efficiently guide you from the CHAMBRE ENFANT 11 to the central HALL area using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
