Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the PORCHE to the BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
1. PORCHE connects to SEJOUR through D1
2. SEJOUR connects to CUISINE through D2 and D3
3. SEJOUR connects to CH.1 through D4
4. CH.1 connects to DEGT through D5
5. CH.2 connects to DEGT through D6
6. DEGT connects to BAINS through D7
7. DEGT connects to WC through D8

Now, let's create the navigation plan:

1. Start in PORCHE
2. ApproachDoor(D1)
3. OpenDoor(D1)
4. GoThrough(D1) - Now in SEJOUR
5. ApproachDoor(D3)
6. OpenDoor(D3)
7. GoThrough(D3) - Now in CUISINE
8. ApproachDoor(D3)
9. OpenDoor(D3)
10. GoThrough(D3) - Back in SEJOUR
11. ApproachDoor(D4)
12. OpenDoor(D4)
13. GoThrough(D4) - Now in CH.1
14. ApproachDoor(D5)
15. OpenDoor(D5)
16. GoThrough(D5) - Now in DEGT
17. ApproachDoor(D7)
18. OpenDoor(D7)
19. GoThrough(D7) - Now in BAINS (destination reached)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan efficiently guides you from the PORCHE to the BAINS, using only the necessary doors and rooms along the path.
