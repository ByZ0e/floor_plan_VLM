Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from DEGT to CELLIER.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects Porche and SEJOUR
D2: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
D3: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
D5: Connects DEGT and CH.1
D6: Connects DEGT and CH.2
D7: Connects DEGT and BAINS
D8: Connects DEGT and WC
D9: Connects CH.2 and CH.4
D10: Connects CUISINE and CELLIER

Navigation Plan:
To get from DEGT to CELLIER, we need to go through SEJOUR and CUISINE. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(D4)
2. OpenDoor(D4)
3. GoThrough(D4)
4. ApproachDoor(D3)
5. OpenDoor(D3)
6. GoThrough(D3)
7. ApproachDoor(D10)
8. OpenDoor(D10)
9. GoThrough(D10)

Here's the plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D10"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates you from DEGT to CELLIER using only the necessary doors and rooms.
