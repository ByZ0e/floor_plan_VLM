Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from PORCHE 1 to CELLIER.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D21 connects PORCHE1 to CELLIER 1
2. D31 connects PORCHE1 to HALL1
3. D41 connects HALL1 to WC1
4. D51 connects HALL1 to LINGERIE1
5. D61 connects HALL1 to BUREAU1
6. D71 connects HALL1 to BAINS1
7. D81 connects HALL1 to CHAMBRE PARENTS1
8. D91 connects HALL1 to CHAMBRE ENFANT 21
9. D101 connects HALL1 to CHAMBRE ENFANT 11
10. D111 connects CELLIER 1 to HALL1
11. D13 connects GARAGE1 to CELLIER 1

Navigation Plan:
To go from PORCHE1 to CELLIER, we only need to use one door:

1. ApproachDoor(21)
2. OpenDoor(21)
3. GoThrough(21)

This sequence will take you directly from PORCHE1 to CELLIER 1.

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "PORCHE1",
  "end": "CELLIER",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 21},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 21},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 21}
  ]
}
```

This is the most efficient path from PORCHE1 to CELLIER, using only the necessary door (D21) to reach the destination.
