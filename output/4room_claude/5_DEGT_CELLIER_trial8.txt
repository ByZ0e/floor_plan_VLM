Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from DEGT to CELLIER.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects Porche and SEJOUR
D2: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
D3: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
D5: Connects DEGT and CH.1
D6: Connects DEGT and CH.2
D7: Connects DEGT and BAINS
D8: Connects DEGT and WC
D9: Connects CH.2 and CH.4
D10: Connects CUISINE and CELLIER

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in DEGT
2. Use D4 to enter SEJOUR
3. Use D2 or D3 to enter CUISINE
4. Use D10 to reach CELLIER

Based on this analysis, here's the efficient navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D10"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from DEGT to CELLIER using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours or rooms.
