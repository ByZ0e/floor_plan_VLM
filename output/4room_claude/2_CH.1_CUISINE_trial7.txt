Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CH.1 connects to SEJOUR via D4
2. SEJOUR connects to CUISINE via D3
3. SEJOUR connects to DEGT via D4
4. DEGT connects to CH.2 via D6
5. DEGT connects to BAINS via D7
6. DEGT connects to WC via D8
7. PORCHE connects to SEJOUR via D1
8. CELLIER connects to CUISINE via D2
9. CH.2 has no direct connection to CUISINE

Based on these connections, here's the step-by-step navigation plan to go from CH.1 to CUISINE:

1. ApproachDoor(D4)
2. OpenDoor(D4)
3. GoThrough(D4)
4. ApproachDoor(D3)
5. OpenDoor(D3)
6. GoThrough(D3)

Now, I'll provide the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CH.1",
  "end": "CUISINE",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan takes you from CH.1 to SEJOUR through D4, and then from SEJOUR to CUISINE through D3, which is the most direct and efficient route based on the floor plan provided.
