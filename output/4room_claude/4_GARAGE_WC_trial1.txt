Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the GARAGE to the WC.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D9: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER
2. D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
3. D2: Connects HALL to BAINS/WC area

Navigation Plan:

To navigate from the GARAGE to the WC, we need to go through the following doors in this order: D9, D1, and D2.

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in GARAGE
2. Use D9 to enter CELLIER
3. Use D1 to enter HALL
4. Use D2 to reach the BAINS/WC area

Here's the detailed action plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "doorNumber": 9
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "doorNumber": 9
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "doorNumber": 9
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "doorNumber": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "doorNumber": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "doorNumber": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "doorNumber": 2
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "doorNumber": 2
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "doorNumber": 2
    }
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan provides the most direct and efficient route from the GARAGE to the WC, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
