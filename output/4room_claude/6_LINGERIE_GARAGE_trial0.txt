Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Garage <-> Cellier
D2: Cellier <-> Porche
D3: Porche <-> Hall
D4: Hall <-> WC
D5: Lingerie <-> Hall
D6: Bureau <-> Hall
D7: Bains <-> Hall
D8: Chambre Parents <-> Hall
D9: Hall <-> Chambre Enfant 2
D10: Hall <-> Chambre Enfant 1
D11: Cellier <-> Hall
D12: Hall (upper) <-> Hall (lower)

Now, for the navigation task from LINGERIE to GARAGE:

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in Lingerie
2. Use D5 to enter Hall
3. Use D11 to enter Cellier
4. Use D1 to enter Garage

Based on these steps, here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 11},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides an efficient route from the Lingerie to the Garage, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
