Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the CUISINE to CH.2.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects SEJOUR and Porche
- D2: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
- D3: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
- D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
- D5: Connects CH.1 and DEGT
- D6: Connects CH.2 and DEGT
- D7: Connects BAINS and DEGT
- D8: Connects WC and DEGT

Now, let's create the navigation plan from CUISINE to CH.2:

1. Start in CUISINE
2. ApproachDoor(D3)
3. OpenDoor(D3)
4. GoThrough(D3)
5. ApproachDoor(D4)
6. OpenDoor(D4)
7. GoThrough(D4)
8. ApproachDoor(D6)
9. OpenDoor(D6)
10. GoThrough(D6)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CUISINE",
  "end": "CH.2",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"}
  ]
}
```

This path takes you from the CUISINE through the SEJOUR and DEGT to reach CH.2, using only the necessary doors along the way.
