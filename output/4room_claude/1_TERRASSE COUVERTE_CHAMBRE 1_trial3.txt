Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to CHAMBRE 1.

Room and Door Connections:

D8: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE and CUISINE
D7: Connects CUISINE and HALL
D6: Connects HALL and PORCHE
D5: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 2
D4: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 1
D3: Connects HALL and WC
D2: Connects HALL and BAINS
D1: Connects HALL and CELLIER
D9: Connects CELLIER and GARAGE

Navigation Plan:

To go from TERRASSE COUVERTE to CHAMBRE 1, we need to use doors D8, D7, and D4. Here's the detailed plan:

1. ApproachDoor(8)
2. OpenDoor(8)
3. GoThrough(8)
4. ApproachDoor(7)
5. OpenDoor(7)
6. GoThrough(7)
7. ApproachDoor(4)
8. OpenDoor(4)
9. GoThrough(4)

This plan takes you from TERRASSE COUVERTE through the CUISINE, into the HALL, and finally into CHAMBRE 1.

Here's the plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from TERRASSE COUVERTE to CHAMBRE 1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
