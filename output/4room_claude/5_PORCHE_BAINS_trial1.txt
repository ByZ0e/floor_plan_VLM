Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a detailed navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects Porche to Sejour
2. D2 connects Sejour to Cuisine
3. D3 connects Sejour to Cuisine
4. D4 connects Sejour to Degt
5. D5 connects Degt to Ch.1
6. D6 connects Degt to Ch.2
7. D7 connects Degt to Bains
8. D8 connects Degt to WC

Step-by-step Solution:
1. Start in Porche
2. Use D1 to enter Sejour
3. Use D4 to enter Degt
4. Use D7 to reach Bains

Now, I'll provide the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan provides the most efficient path from Porche to Bains, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
