Thank you for providing the floor plan and instructions. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from DEGT 1 to DEGT.

Room and Door Connections:
D31: Connects SEJOUR1 and CUISINE1
D41: Connects SEJOUR1 and DEGT1
D51: Connects DEGT1 and CH.3
D61: Connects DEGT1 and CH.4
D71: Connects DEGT1 and BAINS1
D3: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
D5: Connects DEGT and CH.1
D6: Connects DEGT and CH.2
D7: Connects DEGT and BAINS
D8: Connects DEGT and WC
D9: Connects CH.2 and CH.4
D10: Connects CELLIER and CUISINE

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in DEGT1
2. ApproachDoor(D41)
3. OpenDoor(D41)
4. GoThrough(D41)
5. ApproachDoor(D4)
6. OpenDoor(D4)
7. GoThrough(D4)

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "DEGT1",
  "end": "DEGT",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D41"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D41"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D41"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from DEGT1 to DEGT using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
