Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the connections and provide a navigation plan as requested. Let's start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections:

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects CELLIER and HALL
D2: Connects BAINS and HALL
D3: Connects WC and HALL
D4: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 1
D5: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 2
D6: Connects HALL and PORCHE
D7: Connects HALL and CUISINE
D8: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Connects CELLIER and GARAGE

Now, let's create the navigation plan to go from BAINS to GARAGE:

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in BAINS
2. Use D2 to enter HALL
3. Use D1 to enter CELLIER
4. Use D9 to enter GARAGE

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 9}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from BAINS to GARAGE using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
