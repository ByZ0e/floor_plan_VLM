Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to CHAMBRE 1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D8: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE and CUISINE
2. D7: Connects CUISINE and HALL
3. D6: Connects HALL and PORCHE
4. D5: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 2
5. D4: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 1
6. D3: Connects HALL and WC
7. D2: Connects HALL and BAINS
8. D1: Connects HALL and CELLIER
9. D9: Connects CELLIER and GARAGE

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in TERRASSE COUVERTE
2. Use D8 to enter CUISINE
3. Use D7 to enter HALL
4. Use D4 to enter CHAMBRE 1

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to CHAMBRE 1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
