Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list the relevant rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the LINGERIE to the GARAGE.

Relevant Room and Door Connections:
- LINGERIE connects to HALL via D5
- HALL connects to CELLIER via D11
- CELLIER connects to GARAGE via D1

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
1. Start in LINGERIE
2. ApproachDoor(D5)
3. OpenDoor(D5)
4. GoThrough(D5) to enter HALL
5. ApproachDoor(D11)
6. OpenDoor(D11)
7. GoThrough(D11) to enter CELLIER
8. ApproachDoor(D1)
9. OpenDoor(D1)
10. GoThrough(D1) to enter GARAGE

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "LINGERIE",
  "end": "GARAGE",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the LINGERIE to the GARAGE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
