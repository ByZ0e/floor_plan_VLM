Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects SEJOUR and PORCHE
2. D2 connects SEJOUR and CELLIER
3. D3 connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
4. D4 connects SEJOUR and DEGT
5. D5 connects CH.1 and DEGT
6. D6 connects CH.2 and DEGT
7. D7 connects BAINS and DEGT
8. D8 connects WC and DEGT

Now, for the navigation task from CUISINE to CH.2:

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CUISINE
2. Use D3 to enter SEJOUR
3. Use D4 to enter DEGT
4. Use D6 to enter CH.2

Based on these steps, here's the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from CUISINE to CH.2, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
