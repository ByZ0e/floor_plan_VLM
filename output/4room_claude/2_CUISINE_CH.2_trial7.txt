Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. Let me first describe the rooms and doors with their connections based on the image:

Room and Door Connections:
1. CUISINE connects to SEJOUR via D3
2. CUISINE connects to WC via D8
3. SEJOUR connects to PORCHE via D1
4. SEJOUR connects to CELLIER via D2
5. SEJOUR connects to CH.1 via D4
6. CH.1 connects to DEGT via D5
7. DEGT connects to CH.2 via D6
8. DEGT connects to BAINS via D7

Now, let's create a step-by-step navigation plan to go from CUISINE to CH.2:

1. ApproachDoor(3)
2. OpenDoor(3)
3. GoThrough(3)
4. ApproachDoor(4)
5. OpenDoor(4)
6. GoThrough(4)
7. ApproachDoor(5)
8. OpenDoor(5)
9. GoThrough(5)
10. ApproachDoor(6)
11. OpenDoor(6)
12. GoThrough(6)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6}
  ]
}
```

This path takes you from the CUISINE through the SEJOUR and DEGT to reach CH.2, using only the necessary doors along the way.
