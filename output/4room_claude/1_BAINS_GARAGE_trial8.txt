Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from BAINS to GARAGE.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects CELLIER and HALL
D2: Connects BAINS and HALL
D3: Connects WC and HALL
D4: Connects CHAMBRE 1 and HALL
D5: Connects CHAMBRE 2 and HALL
D6: Connects HALL and PORCHE
D7: Connects HALL and CUISINE
D8: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Connects CELLIER and GARAGE

Step-by-step navigation plan:

1. Start in BAINS
2. Use D2 to enter HALL
3. Move through HALL to D1
4. Use D1 to enter CELLIER
5. Move through CELLIER to D9
6. Use D9 to enter GARAGE

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 9}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from BAINS to GARAGE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
