Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from DEGT 1 to DEGT.

Explicit Room and Door Connections:
- D31: Connects SEJOUR1 and CUISINE1
- D41: Connects SEJOUR1 and DEGT1
- D51: Connects DEGT1 and CH.3
- D61: Connects DEGT1 and CH.4
- D71: Connects DEGT1 and BAINS1
- D9: Connects CH.2 and CH.4
- D8: Connects DEGT and BAINS
- D7: Connects DEGT and CH.2
- D6: Connects DEGT and CH.1
- D5: Connects DEGT and SEJOUR
- D4: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
- D3: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
- D2: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
- D1: Connects SEJOUR and Porche

Navigation Plan:
To go from DEGT 1 to DEGT, we need to use the following doors: D41, D9, and D7.

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in DEGT 1
2. ApproachDoor(D41)
3. OpenDoor(D41)
4. GoThrough(D41) - Now in SEJOUR1
5. ApproachDoor(D9)
6. OpenDoor(D9)
7. GoThrough(D9) - Now in CH.4
8. ApproachDoor(D9)
9. OpenDoor(D9)
10. GoThrough(D9) - Now in CH.2
11. ApproachDoor(D7)
12. OpenDoor(D7)
13. GoThrough(D7) - Now in DEGT (destination reached)

Final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D41"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D41"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D41"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan provides the most efficient route from DEGT 1 to DEGT, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
