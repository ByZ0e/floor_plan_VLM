Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the GARAGE to the BUREAU.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: GARAGE <-> CELLIER
D2: CELLIER <-> PORCHE
D3: PORCHE <-> HALL
D4: HALL <-> WC
D5: HALL <-> LINGERIE
D6: HALL <-> BUREAU
D7: HALL <-> BAINS
D8: HALL <-> CHAMBRE PARENTS
D9: HALL <-> CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
D10: HALL <-> CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
D11: CELLIER <-> HALL
D12: GARAGE <-> HALL

Navigation Plan:
To go from the GARAGE to the BUREAU, we'll use the following path:
GARAGE -> D12 -> HALL -> D6 -> BUREAU

Here's the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 12},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 12},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 12},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the GARAGE to the BUREAU using the available doors. It avoids unnecessary rooms and doors, ensuring a direct path to the destination.
