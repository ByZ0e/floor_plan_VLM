Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll start by listing the relevant rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Relevant Room and Door Connections:
- CHAMBRE ENFANT 11 <-> D10 <-> HALL
- HALL <-> D9 <-> CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
- HALL <-> D8 <-> CHAMBRE PARENTS
- HALL <-> D7 <-> BAINS
- HALL <-> D6 <-> BUREAU
- HALL <-> D5 <-> LINGERIE
- HALL <-> D4 <-> WC
- HALL <-> D3 <-> PORCHE
- HALL <-> D2 <-> GARAGE
- HALL <-> D1 <-> CELLIER

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in CHAMBRE ENFANT 11
2. Approach door D10
3. Open door D10
4. Go through door D10 to enter HALL

Based on this analysis, here's the efficient navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 10}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CHAMBRE ENFANT 11 to HALL using only the necessary door (D10) and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
