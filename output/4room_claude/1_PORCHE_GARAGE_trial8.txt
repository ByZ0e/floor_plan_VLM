Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the PORCHE to the GARAGE.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
D2: Connects BAINS to HALL
D3: Connects WC to HALL
D4: Connects CHAMBRE 1 to HALL
D5: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to HALL
D6: Connects PORCHE to HALL
D7: Connects CUISINE to HALL
D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE

Navigation Plan:

Starting from the PORCHE, we need to go through the HALL and CELLIER to reach the GARAGE. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(D6)
2. OpenDoor(D6)
3. GoThrough(D6)
4. ApproachDoor(D1)
5. OpenDoor(D1)
6. GoThrough(D1)
7. ApproachDoor(D9)
8. OpenDoor(D9)
9. GoThrough(D9)

Now, here's the plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the PORCHE to the GARAGE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
