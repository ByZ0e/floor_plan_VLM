Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to GARAGE 1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D10: TERRASSE COUVERTE <-> TERRASSE COUVERTE 1
2. D81: TERRASSE COUVERTE 1 <-> CUISINE 1
3. D71: CUISINE 1 <-> HALL 1
4. D61: HALL 1 <-> PORCHE 1
5. D51: HALL 1 <-> CHAMBRE 3
6. D11: HALL 1 <-> BAINS 1
7. D21: BAINS 1 <-> WC 1
8. D31: HALL 1 <-> CHAMBRE 4
9. D41: HALL 1 <-> HALL 1 (different section)
10. D91: CELLIER 1 <-> GARAGE 1

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in TERRASSE COUVERTE
2. Use D10 to enter TERRASSE COUVERTE 1
3. Use D81 to enter CUISINE 1
4. Use D71 to enter HALL 1
5. Use D41 to move to another section of HALL 1
6. Use D91 to enter GARAGE 1

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D81"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D81"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D81"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D71"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D71"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D71"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D41"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D41"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D41"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D91"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D91"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D91"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides an efficient route from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to GARAGE 1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
