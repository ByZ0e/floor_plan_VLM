Thank you for providing the floor plan image. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from WC 1 to CH.2.

Room and Door Connections:

D21: Connects CELLIER1 and CUISINE 1
D31: Connects CUISINE 1 and SEJOUR1
D41: Connects SEJOUR1 and DEGT 1
D51: Connects DEGT 1 and CH.3
D61: Connects DEGT 1 and CH.4
D71: Connects DEGT 1 and BAINS 1
D81: Connects DEGT 1 and WC 1
D9: Connects CH.2 and CH.4
D8: Connects DEGT and WC
D7: Connects DEGT and BAINS
D6: Connects DEGT and CH.2
D5: Connects DEGT and CH.1
D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
D3: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
D2: Connects SEJOUR and CELLIER
D1: Connects SEJOUR and Porche
D10: Connects CELLIER and CELLIER1
D11: Connects Porche1 and SEJOUR1

Step-by-step navigation plan:

1. Start in WC 1
2. ApproachDoor(D81)
3. OpenDoor(D81)
4. GoThrough(D81)
5. ApproachDoor(D61)
6. OpenDoor(D61)
7. GoThrough(D61)
8. ApproachDoor(D9)
9. OpenDoor(D9)
10. GoThrough(D9)

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D81"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D81"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D81"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from WC 1 to CH.2 using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
