Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects Garage and Cellier
- D2: Connects Cellier and Porche
- D3: Connects Porche and Hall
- D4: Connects Hall and WC
- D5: Connects Lingerie and Hall
- D6: Connects Hall and Bureau
- D7: Connects Bureau and Bains
- D8: Connects Bains and Chambre Parents
- D9: Connects Hall and Chambre Enfant 2
- D10: Connects Hall and Chambre Enfant 1
- D11: Connects Cellier and Hall

Navigation Plan:
To go from Lingerie to Garage, we need to use the following doors: D5, D11, and D1.

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in Lingerie
2. Use D5 to enter the Hall
3. Use D11 to enter the Cellier
4. Use D1 to enter the Garage

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 11},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from Lingerie to Garage using only the necessary doors.
