Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects CELLIER and HALL
D2: Connects BAINS and HALL
D3: Connects WC and HALL
D4: Connects CHAMBRE 1 and HALL
D5: Connects CHAMBRE 2 and HALL
D6: Connects PORCHE and HALL
D7: Connects CUISINE and HALL
D8: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Connects CELLIER and GARAGE

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
1. Start in TERRASSE COUVERTE
2. ApproachDoor(D8)
3. OpenDoor(D8)
4. GoThrough(D8) to enter CUISINE
5. ApproachDoor(D7)
6. OpenDoor(D7)
7. GoThrough(D7) to enter HALL
8. ApproachDoor(D4)
9. OpenDoor(D4)
10. GoThrough(D4) to enter CHAMBRE 1

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan provides the most efficient path from TERRASSE COUVERTE to CHAMBRE 1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
