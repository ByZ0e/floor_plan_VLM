Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll first list the relevant rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Relevant Room and Door Connections:
- PORCHE1 <-> D21 <-> CELLIER 1
- CELLIER 1 <-> D13 <-> GARAGE 1
- CELLIER 1 <-> D111 <-> HALL 1

Step-by-step Solution:
1. Start in PORCHE1
2. ApproachDoor(D21)
3. OpenDoor(D21)
4. GoThrough(D21)

This sequence will take you directly from PORCHE1 to CELLIER 1, which is the most efficient path to reach the destination.

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "PORCHE1",
  "end": "CELLIER 1",
  "steps": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D21"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D21"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D21"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from PORCHE1 to CELLIER 1 using only the necessary doors and actions.
