Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from BAINS 1 to CUISINE 1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D11 connects BAINS 1 and HALL 1
2. D21 connects WC 1 and HALL 1
3. D31 connects HALL 1 and CHAMBRE 4
4. D41 connects HALL 1 and HALL 1 (different sections)
5. D51 connects HALL 1 and CHAMBRE 3
6. D61 connects HALL 1 and PORCHE 1
7. D71 connects PORCHE 1 and CUISINE 1
8. D81 connects CUISINE 1 and TERRASSE COUVERTE 1
9. D91 connects CELLIER 1 and GARAGE 1

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in BAINS 1
2. ApproachDoor(D11)
3. OpenDoor(D11)
4. GoThrough(D11) to enter HALL 1
5. ApproachDoor(D61)
6. OpenDoor(D61)
7. GoThrough(D61) to enter PORCHE 1
8. ApproachDoor(D71)
9. OpenDoor(D71)
10. GoThrough(D71) to enter CUISINE 1

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "BAINS 1",
  "end": "CUISINE 1",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D71"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D71"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D71"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from BAINS 1 to CUISINE 1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
