Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from BAINS 1 to CUISINE 1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D11: Connects BAINS 1 to HALL 1
2. D21: Connects WC 1 to HALL 1
3. D31: Connects CHAMBRE 4 to HALL 1
4. D41: Connects CHAMBRE 4 to HALL 1
5. D51: Connects CHAMBRE 3 to HALL 1
6. D61: Connects HALL 1 to PORCHE 1
7. D71: Connects PORCHE 1 to CUISINE 1
8. D81: Connects CUISINE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE 1
9. D91: Connects CELLIER 1 to GARAGE 1

Navigation Plan:
To go from BAINS 1 to CUISINE 1, we need to follow these steps:

1. Exit BAINS 1 to HALL 1
2. Move through HALL 1 to PORCHE 1
3. Enter CUISINE 1 from PORCHE 1

Here's the detailed action plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "doorNumber": 11
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "doorNumber": 11
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "doorNumber": 11
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "doorNumber": 61
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "doorNumber": 61
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "doorNumber": 61
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "doorNumber": 71
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "doorNumber": 71
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "doorNumber": 71
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from BAINS 1 to CUISINE 1 using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
