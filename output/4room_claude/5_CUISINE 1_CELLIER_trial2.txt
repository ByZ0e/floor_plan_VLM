Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from CUISINE 1 to CELLIER.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D21 connects CELLIER1 and CUISINE 1
2. D31 connects CUISINE 1 and SEJOUR1
3. D71 connects SEJOUR1 and BAINS 1
4. D61 connects SEJOUR1 and CH.4
5. D51 connects SEJOUR1 and DEGT 1
6. D41 connects SEJOUR1 and CH.3
7. D11 connects SEJOUR1 and Porche1
8. D10 connects Porche1 and CELLIER
9. D2 connects CELLIER and CUISINE
10. D3 connects CUISINE and SEJOUR
11. D7 connects SEJOUR and BAINS
12. D6 connects SEJOUR and CH.2
13. D5 connects SEJOUR and DEGT
14. D4 connects SEJOUR and CH.1
15. D1 connects SEJOUR and Porche

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in CUISINE 1
2. Use D31 to enter SEJOUR1
3. Use D11 to enter Porche1
4. Use D10 to enter CELLIER

JSON format navigation plan:
```json
{
  "start": "CUISINE 1",
  "end": "CELLIER",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D31"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D31"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D31"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D10"}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan provides the most efficient route from CUISINE 1 to CELLIER based on the floor plan provided.
