Certainly! I'll provide you with a detailed navigation plan based on the floor plan image you've shared. Let's start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, and then I'll give you the step-by-step navigation plan.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D4: Connects LINGERIE to HALL
D5: Connects HALL to BUREAU
D6: Connects BUREAU to HALL
D11: Connects HALL to CELLIER
D1: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE

Step-by-step navigation plan:

1. Start in LINGERIE
2. ApproachDoor(D4)
3. OpenDoor(D4)
4. GoThrough(D4) to enter HALL
5. ApproachDoor(D11)
6. OpenDoor(D11)
7. GoThrough(D11) to enter CELLIER
8. ApproachDoor(D1)
9. OpenDoor(D1)
10. GoThrough(D1) to enter GARAGE

Now, I'll provide the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "LINGERIE",
  "end": "GARAGE",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan provides the most efficient path from the LINGERIE to the GARAGE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours. The plan takes into account that doors close after each GoThrough action, so each door is approached, opened, and gone through in sequence.
