Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the PORCHE to the GARAGE.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects CELLIER and HALL
D2: Connects HALL and WC
D3: Connects HALL and BAINS
D4: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 1
D5: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 2
D6: Connects HALL and PORCHE
D7: Connects HALL and CUISINE
D8: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Connects CELLIER and GARAGE

Navigation Plan:
To get from the PORCHE to the GARAGE, we need to go through the HALL and CELLIER. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(6)
2. OpenDoor(6)
3. GoThrough(6)
4. ApproachDoor(1)
5. OpenDoor(1)
6. GoThrough(1)
7. ApproachDoor(9)
8. OpenDoor(9)
9. GoThrough(9)

Here's the plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 9}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the PORCHE to the GARAGE using only the necessary doors and rooms. The robot will start in the PORCHE, move through the HALL, then the CELLIER, and finally reach the GARAGE.
