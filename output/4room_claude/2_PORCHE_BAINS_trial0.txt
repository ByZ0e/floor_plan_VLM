Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan from PORCHE to BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
1. PORCHE connects to SEJOUR through D1
2. SEJOUR connects to CUISINE through D2 and D3
3. SEJOUR connects to DEGT through D4
4. CH.1 connects to DEGT through D5
5. CH.2 connects to DEGT through D6
6. DEGT connects to BAINS through D7
7. DEGT connects to WC through D8
8. CELLIER is not connected to any other room via doors shown

Navigation Plan:
To go from PORCHE to BAINS, we need to follow this path: PORCHE -> SEJOUR -> DEGT -> BAINS

Here's the detailed step-by-step navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from PORCHE to BAINS, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
