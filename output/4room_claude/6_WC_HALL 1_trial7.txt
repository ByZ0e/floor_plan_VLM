Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the relevant rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from the WC to HALL 1.

Relevant Room and Door Connections:
- WC: connected to HALL via D4
- HALL: connected to WC via D4, LINGERIE via D5, BUREAU via D6, BAINS via D7, HALL (main area) via D10
- LINGERIE: connected to HALL via D5
- BUREAU: connected to HALL via D6
- BAINS: connected to HALL via D7
- HALL (main area): connected to HALL via D10, CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 (no door needed)

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in WC
2. ApproachDoor(D4)
3. OpenDoor(D4)
4. GoThrough(D4) to enter HALL
5. Move through HALL (no door needed)
6. ApproachDoor(D10)
7. OpenDoor(D10)
8. GoThrough(D10) to enter main HALL 1 area

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "WC",
  "end": "HALL 1",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D10"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the WC to HALL 1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
