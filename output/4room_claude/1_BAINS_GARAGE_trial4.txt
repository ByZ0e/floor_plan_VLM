Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a detailed navigation plan to get from BAINS to GARAGE.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects CELLIER and HALL
- D2: Connects BAINS and HALL
- D3: Connects WC and HALL
- D4: Connects CHAMBRE 1 and HALL
- D5: Connects CHAMBRE 2 and HALL
- D6: Connects HALL and PORCHE
- D7: Connects HALL and CUISINE
- D8: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
- D9: Connects CELLIER and GARAGE

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in BAINS
2. Use D2 to enter HALL
3. Use D1 to enter CELLIER
4. Use D9 to reach GARAGE

Now, I'll provide the detailed action sequence in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 2
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 2
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 2
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 9
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 9
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 9
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from BAINS to GARAGE using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
