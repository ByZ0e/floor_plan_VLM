Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from CUISINE 1 to CELLIER.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D21: Connects CELLIER1 and CUISINE 1
2. D31: Connects CUISINE 1 and SEJOUR1
3. D10: Connects SEJOUR1 and CELLIER
4. D2: Connects CUISINE and CELLIER

Navigation Plan:

To navigate from CUISINE 1 to CELLIER, we need to go through SEJOUR1. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(D21)
2. OpenDoor(D21)
3. GoThrough(D21)
4. ApproachDoor(D31)
5. OpenDoor(D31)
6. GoThrough(D31)
7. ApproachDoor(D10)
8. OpenDoor(D10)
9. GoThrough(D10)

Here's the plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CUISINE 1",
  "end": "CELLIER",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D21"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D21"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D21"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D31"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D31"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D31"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D10"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from CUISINE 1 to CELLIER using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
