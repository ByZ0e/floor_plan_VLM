Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the connections and provide a navigation plan as requested.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects Garage and Cellier
D2: Connects Porche and Cellier
D3: Connects Porche and Hall
D4: Connects Hall and WC
D5: Connects Hall and Lingerie
D6: Connects Hall and Bureau
D7: Connects Hall and Bains
D8: Connects Hall and Chambre Parents
D9: Connects Hall and Chambre Enfant 2
D10: Connects Hall and Chambre Enfant 1
D11: Connects Cellier and Hall
D12: Connects Hall 1 and Porche 1
D13: Connects Garage 1 and Cellier 1
D21: Connects Porche 1 and Cellier 1
D31: Connects Porche 1 and Hall 1
D41: Connects Hall 1 and WC 1
D51: Connects Hall 1 and Lingerie 1
D61: Connects Hall 1 and Bureau 1
D71: Connects Hall 1 and Bains 1
D81: Connects Hall 1 and Chambre Parents 1
D91: Connects Hall 1 and Chambre Enfant 2 1
D101: Connects Hall 1 and Chambre Enfant 1 1
D111: Connects Cellier 1 and Hall 1

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in WC 1
2. Use D41 to enter Hall 1

The navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 41},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 41},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 41}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from WC 1 to Hall 1 using only the necessary door (D41). The robot will approach the door, open it, and go through to reach the destination.
