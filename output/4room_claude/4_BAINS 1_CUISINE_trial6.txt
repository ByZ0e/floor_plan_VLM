Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the room and door connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from BAINS 1 to CUISINE.

Room and Door Connections:
- D11 connects BAINS 1 to HALL 1
- D21 connects WC 1 to HALL 1
- D31 connects CHAMBRE 4 to HALL 1
- D41 connects HALL 1 to HALL 1 (different sections)
- D51 connects CHAMBRE 3 to HALL 1
- D61 connects HALL 1 to PORCHE 1
- D71 connects PORCHE 1 to CUISINE 1
- D81 connects CUISINE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE 1
- D91 connects CELLIER 1 to GARAGE 1

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in BAINS 1
2. ApproachDoor(D11)
3. OpenDoor(D11)
4. GoThrough(D11) to enter HALL 1
5. ApproachDoor(D61)
6. OpenDoor(D61)
7. GoThrough(D61) to enter PORCHE 1
8. ApproachDoor(D71)
9. OpenDoor(D71)
10. GoThrough(D71) to enter CUISINE 1

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D71"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D71"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D71"}
  ]
}
```

This path takes you from BAINS 1 to CUISINE 1 using the most direct route available based on the door connections in the floor plan.
