Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll start by listing the relevant rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Relevant Room and Door Connections:
- CHAMBRE ENFANT 11 connects to HALL 1 via door D101
- HALL 1 connects to HALL 1 (main area) via door D91

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
1. Start in CHAMBRE ENFANT 11
2. ApproachDoor(D101)
3. OpenDoor(D101)
4. GoThrough(D101) to enter HALL 1
5. ApproachDoor(D91)
6. OpenDoor(D91)
7. GoThrough(D91) to enter the main HALL 1 area

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CHAMBRE ENFANT 11",
  "end": "HALL",
  "steps": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D101"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D101"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D101"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D91"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D91"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D91"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides an efficient and correct path from CHAMBRE ENFANT 11 to the main HALL area, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
