Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from DEGT to CELLIER.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects SEJOUR and Porche
D2: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
D3: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
D5: Connects DEGT and CH.1
D6: Connects DEGT and CH.2
D7: Connects DEGT and BAINS
D8: Connects DEGT and WC

Now, let's create the navigation plan from DEGT to CELLIER:

1. We start in DEGT.
2. We need to go through SEJOUR to reach CELLIER.
3. The path will be: DEGT -> SEJOUR -> CELLIER

Step-by-step solution:
1. From DEGT, approach D4
2. Open D4
3. Go through D4 to enter SEJOUR
4. In SEJOUR, approach D2
5. Open D2
6. Go through D2 to enter CELLIER

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from DEGT to CELLIER using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
