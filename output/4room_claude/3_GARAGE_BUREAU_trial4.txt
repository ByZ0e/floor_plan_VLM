Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms, doors, and their connections, then provide a navigation plan from the GARAGE to the BUREAU.

Explicit Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER
D2: Connects CELLIER to PORCHE
D3: Connects PORCHE to HALL
D4: Connects HALL to WC
D5: Connects HALL to LINGERIE
D6: Connects HALL to BUREAU
D7: Connects HALL to BAINS
D8: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE PARENTS
D9: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
D10: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
D11: Connects CELLIER to HALL

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in GARAGE
2. Use D1 to enter CELLIER
3. Use D3 to enter HALL
4. Use D6 to reach BUREAU

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the GARAGE to the BUREAU, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
