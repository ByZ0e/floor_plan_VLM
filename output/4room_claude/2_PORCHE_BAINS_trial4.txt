Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the PORCHE to the BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
1. PORCHE connects to SEJOUR through D1
2. SEJOUR connects to CUISINE through D3
3. SEJOUR connects to DEGT through D4
4. DEGT connects to CH.2 through D6
5. DEGT connects to WC through D8
6. DEGT connects to BAINS through D7

Navigation Plan:
To go from PORCHE to BAINS, we need to pass through SEJOUR, DEGT, and finally reach BAINS. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(1)
2. OpenDoor(1)
3. GoThrough(1)
4. ApproachDoor(4)
5. OpenDoor(4)
6. GoThrough(4)
7. ApproachDoor(7)
8. OpenDoor(7)
9. GoThrough(7)

JSON format of the navigation plan:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the PORCHE to the BAINS using only the necessary doors and rooms.
