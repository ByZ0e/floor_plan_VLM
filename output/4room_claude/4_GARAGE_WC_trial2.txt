Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the GARAGE to the WC.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D9: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER
2. D1: Connects CELLIER and HALL
3. D2: Connects HALL and WC

Navigation Plan:

1. Start in GARAGE
2. ApproachDoor(D9)
3. OpenDoor(D9)
4. GoThrough(D9) - Now in CELLIER
5. ApproachDoor(D1)
6. OpenDoor(D1)
7. GoThrough(D1) - Now in HALL
8. ApproachDoor(D2)
9. OpenDoor(D2)
10. GoThrough(D2) - Now in WC (destination reached)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"}
  ]
}
```

This path takes you from the GARAGE to the WC using the most direct route available based on the floor plan provided.
