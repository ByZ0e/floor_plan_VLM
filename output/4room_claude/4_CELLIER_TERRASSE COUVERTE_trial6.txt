Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the CELLIER to the TERRASSE COUVERTE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D9: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE
2. D1: Connects HALL to BAINS
3. D2: Connects HALL to WC
4. D3: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
5. D4: Connects HALL to HALL
6. D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 2
7. D6: Connects HALL to PORCHE
8. D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE
9. D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
10. D10: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE to TERRASSE

Navigation Plan:
To get from the CELLIER to the TERRASSE COUVERTE, we need to go through the following sequence of rooms: CELLIER -> GARAGE -> HALL -> CUISINE -> TERRASSE COUVERTE.

Here's the step-by-step navigation plan:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the CELLIER to the TERRASSE COUVERTE using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
