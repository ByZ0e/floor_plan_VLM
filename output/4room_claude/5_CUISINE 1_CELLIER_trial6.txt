Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from CUISINE 1 to CELLIER.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D21: Connects CUISINE 1 and CELLIER 1
2. D31: Connects CUISINE 1 and SEJOUR 1
3. D11: Connects CELLIER 1 and PORCHE 1
4. D10: Connects CELLIER and CELLIER 1
5. D2: Connects CUISINE and CELLIER
6. D3: Connects CUISINE and SEJOUR

Navigation Plan:
To go from CUISINE 1 to CELLIER, we need to use the following doors: D21, D10

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CUISINE 1
2. Use D21 to enter CELLIER 1
3. Use D10 to enter CELLIER

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CUISINE 1",
  "end": "CELLIER",
  "actions": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D21"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D21"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D21"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D10"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from CUISINE 1 to CELLIER using only the necessary doors.
