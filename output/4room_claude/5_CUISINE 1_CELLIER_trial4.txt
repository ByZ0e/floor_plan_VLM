Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from CUISINE 1 to CELLIER.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D21 connects CELLIER1 and CUISINE 1
2. D31 connects CUISINE 1 and SEJOUR1
3. D71 connects SEJOUR1 and BAINS 1
4. D61 connects SEJOUR1 and CH.4
5. D51 connects SEJOUR1 and DEGT 1
6. D41 connects SEJOUR1 and CH.3
7. D11 connects SEJOUR1 and Porche1
8. D10 connects Porche1 and CELLIER
9. D2 connects CELLIER and CUISINE
10. D3 connects CUISINE and SEJOUR
11. D7 connects SEJOUR and BAINS
12. D6 connects SEJOUR and CH.2
13. D5 connects SEJOUR and DEGT
14. D4 connects SEJOUR and CH.1
15. D1 connects SEJOUR and Porche

Navigation Plan:
To get from CUISINE 1 to CELLIER, we need to go through SEJOUR1 and Porche1. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(D31)
2. OpenDoor(D31)
3. GoThrough(D31)
4. ApproachDoor(D11)
5. OpenDoor(D11)
6. GoThrough(D11)
7. ApproachDoor(D10)
8. OpenDoor(D10)
9. GoThrough(D10)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D31"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D31"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D31"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D10"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from CUISINE 1 to CELLIER using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
