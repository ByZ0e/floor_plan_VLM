Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from DEGT to CELLIER.

Room and Door Connections:
1. DEGT connects to SEJOUR via D4
2. DEGT connects to CH.2 via D6
3. DEGT connects to BAINS via D7
4. SEJOUR connects to CUISINE via D3
5. SEJOUR connects to Porche via D1
6. CUISINE connects to CELLIER via D2
7. CH.1 connects to SEJOUR via D5
8. BAINS connects to WC via D8

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in DEGT
2. ApproachDoor(D4)
3. OpenDoor(D4)
4. GoThrough(D4) to enter SEJOUR
5. ApproachDoor(D3)
6. OpenDoor(D3)
7. GoThrough(D3) to enter CUISINE
8. ApproachDoor(D2)
9. OpenDoor(D2)
10. GoThrough(D2) to arrive at CELLIER

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "DEGT",
  "end": "CELLIER",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from DEGT to CELLIER, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
