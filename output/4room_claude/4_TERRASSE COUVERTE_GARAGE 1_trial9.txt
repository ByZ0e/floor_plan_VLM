Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the connections and provide a navigation plan as requested.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D10: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE to TERRASSE COUVERTE 1
D81: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE 1 to CUISINE1
D71: Connects CUISINE1 to HALL1
D61: Connects HALL1 to PORCHE 1
D51: Connects HALL1 to CHAMBRE 3
D11: Connects HALL1 to BAINS 1
D91: Connects CELLIER1 to GARAGE1

Step-by-step navigation plan:

1. Start in TERRASSE COUVERTE
2. Use D10 to enter TERRASSE COUVERTE 1
3. Use D81 to enter CUISINE1
4. Use D71 to enter HALL1
5. Use D91 to enter GARAGE1

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D81"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D81"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D81"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D71"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D71"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D71"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D91"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D91"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D91"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from TERRASSE COUVERTE to GARAGE1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
