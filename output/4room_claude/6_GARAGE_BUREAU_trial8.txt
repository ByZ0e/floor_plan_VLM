Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the GARAGE to the BUREAU.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER
D2: Connects CELLIER to PORCHE
D3: Connects PORCHE to HALL
D4: Connects HALL to WC
D5: Connects HALL to LINGERIE
D6: Connects HALL to BUREAU
D7: Connects HALL to BAINS
D8: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE PARENTS
D9: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
D10: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
D11: Connects CELLIER to HALL
D12: Connects HALL to GARAGE (upper part)

Navigation Plan:
To go from GARAGE to BUREAU, we need to use the following doors: D1, D11, and D6.

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in GARAGE
2. ApproachDoor(1)
3. OpenDoor(1)
4. GoThrough(1) // Now in CELLIER
5. ApproachDoor(11)
6. OpenDoor(11)
7. GoThrough(11) // Now in HALL
8. ApproachDoor(6)
9. OpenDoor(6)
10. GoThrough(6) // Now in BUREAU

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "doorNumber": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "doorNumber": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "doorNumber": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "doorNumber": 11},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "doorNumber": 11},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "doorNumber": 11},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "doorNumber": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "doorNumber": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "doorNumber": 6}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from the GARAGE to the BUREAU using only the necessary doors.
