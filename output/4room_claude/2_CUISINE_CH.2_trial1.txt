Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms, doors, and their connections, then provide a navigation plan from the CUISINE to CH.2.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

Rooms:
- Porche
- CELLIER
- CUISINE (2 sections)
- SEJOUR (3 sections)
- CH.1 (2 sections)
- CH.2 (3 sections)
- DEGT (Dégagement/Hallway)
- WC
- BAINS

Doors and their connections:
D1: Connects SEJOUR to Porche
D2: Connects CUISINE to CELLIER
D3: Connects CUISINE to SEJOUR
D4: Connects SEJOUR to DEGT
D5: Connects CH.1 to DEGT
D6: Connects CH.2 to DEGT
D7: Connects BAINS to DEGT
D8: Connects WC to DEGT

Navigation Plan:
To go from CUISINE to CH.2, we need to use doors D3, D4, and D6. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. Start in CUISINE
2. ApproachDoor(3)
3. OpenDoor(3)
4. GoThrough(3) // Now in SEJOUR
5. ApproachDoor(4)
6. OpenDoor(4)
7. GoThrough(4) // Now in DEGT
8. ApproachDoor(6)
9. OpenDoor(6)
10. GoThrough(6) // Now in CH.2

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from CUISINE to CH.2, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
