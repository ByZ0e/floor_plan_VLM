Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. Let's start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections based on the image:

Room and Door Connections:
1. DEGT connects to SEJOUR via D4
2. DEGT connects to CH.2 via D6
3. DEGT connects to WC via D8
4. SEJOUR connects to CUISINE via D3
5. SEJOUR connects to Porche via D1
6. CUISINE connects to CELLIER via D2
7. CH.1 connects to SEJOUR via D5

Now, let's create the navigation plan to go from DEGT to CELLIER:

Step 1: Exit DEGT to SEJOUR
Step 2: Go from SEJOUR to CUISINE
Step 3: Go from CUISINE to CELLIER

Here's the detailed action plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 2
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 2
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 2
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from DEGT to CELLIER using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
