Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan based on this information.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects Garage and Cellier
- D2: Connects Cellier and Porche
- D3: Connects Porche and Hall
- D4: Connects Hall and WC
- D5: Connects Hall and Lingerie
- D6: Connects Hall and Bureau
- D7: Connects Hall and Bains
- D8: Connects Hall and Chambre Parents
- D9: Connects Hall and Chambre Enfant 2
- D10: Connects Hall and Chambre Enfant 1
- D11: Connects Cellier and Hall

Navigation Plan:
Starting from Chambre Parents to reach Garage, we need to use the following path:
Chambre Parents -> Hall -> Cellier -> Garage

Step-by-step solution:
1. ApproachDoor(8)
2. OpenDoor(8)
3. GoThrough(8)
4. ApproachDoor(11)
5. OpenDoor(11)
6. GoThrough(11)
7. ApproachDoor(1)
8. OpenDoor(1)
9. GoThrough(1)

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 11},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from Chambre Parents to Garage, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
