Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a detailed navigation plan.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER
D2: Connects CELLIER to PORCHE
D3: Connects PORCHE to HALL
D4: Connects HALL to WC
D5: Connects HALL to LINGERIE
D6: Connects HALL to BUREAU
D7: Connects HALL to BAINS
D8: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE PARENTS
D9: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
D10: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
D11: Connects CELLIER to HALL
D12: Connects GARAGE to HALL

Now, let's create a step-by-step navigation plan from WC to HALL 1:

1. Start in WC
2. ApproachDoor(D4)
3. OpenDoor(D4)
4. GoThrough(D4)

The navigation is complete as we have reached HALL 1 directly from WC.

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "WC",
  "end": "HALL 1",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
  ]
}
```

This is the most efficient and correct path from WC to HALL 1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or actions.
