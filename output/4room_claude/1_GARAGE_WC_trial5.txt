Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the connections and provide a navigation plan as requested.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects Cellier to Hall
D2: Connects Bains to Hall
D3: Connects WC to Hall
D4: Connects Chambre 1 to Hall
D5: Connects Chambre 2 to Hall
D6: Connects Porche to Hall
D7: Connects Cuisine to Hall
D8: Connects Cuisine to Terrasse Couverte
D9: Connects Cellier to Garage

Step-by-step navigation plan from Garage to WC:

1. Start in Garage
2. Use D9 to enter Cellier
3. Use D1 to enter Hall
4. Use D3 to enter WC

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 9},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from the Garage to the WC, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
