Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the PORCHE to the BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
1. PORCHE connects to SEJOUR via D1
2. SEJOUR connects to CUISINE via D2
3. SEJOUR connects to DEGT via D4
4. CUISINE connects to SEJOUR via D3
5. CH.1 connects to DEGT via D5
6. CH.2 connects to DEGT via D6
7. DEGT connects to BAINS via D7
8. DEGT connects to WC via D8

Navigation Plan:
To go from PORCHE to BAINS, we need to follow this path: PORCHE -> SEJOUR -> DEGT -> BAINS

Here's the detailed step-by-step plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the PORCHE to the BAINS using only the necessary doors and rooms. The robot will start in the PORCHE, move through the SEJOUR and DEGT, and finally reach the BAINS.
