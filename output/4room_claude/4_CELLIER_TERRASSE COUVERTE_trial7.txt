Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from CELLIER to TERRASSE COUVERTE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D9: Connects CELLIER and GARAGE
2. D1: Connects HALL and BAINS
3. D2: Connects HALL and WC
4. D3: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 1
5. D4: Connects HALL areas
6. D5: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 2
7. D6: Connects HALL and PORCHE
8. D7: Connects HALL and CUISINE
9. D8: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
10. D10: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE areas

Navigation Plan:
To go from CELLIER to TERRASSE COUVERTE, we need to follow these steps:

1. Start in CELLIER
2. Use D9 to enter GARAGE
3. Use D6 to enter HALL
4. Use D7 to enter CUISINE
5. Use D8 to reach TERRASSE COUVERTE

Here's the detailed action plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D9"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D9"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D9"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D6"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D6"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D6"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D7"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D7"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D7"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D8"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D8"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D8"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from CELLIER to TERRASSE COUVERTE using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
