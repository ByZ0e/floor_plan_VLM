Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the LINGERIE to the GARAGE.

Room and Door Connections:
- D51: Connects LINGERIE to HALL 1
- D61: Connects BUREAU1 to HALL 1
- D71: Connects BAINS1 to HALL 1
- D81: Connects CHAMBRE PARENTS1 to HALL 1
- D91: Connects HALL 1 to HALL 1 (different sections)
- D101: Connects CHAMBRE ENFANT 11 to HALL 1
- D111: Connects CELLIER 1 to HALL 1
- D21: Connects PORCHE1 to HALL 1
- D31: Connects HALL1 to PORCHE1
- D13: Connects GARAGE 1 to CELLIER 1

Navigation Plan:
To get from LINGERIE to GARAGE, we need to follow these steps:

1. ApproachDoor(D51)
2. OpenDoor(D51)
3. GoThrough(D51)
4. ApproachDoor(D111)
5. OpenDoor(D111)
6. GoThrough(D111)
7. ApproachDoor(D13)
8. OpenDoor(D13)
9. GoThrough(D13)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D51"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D51"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D51"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D111"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D111"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D111"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D13"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D13"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D13"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the LINGERIE to the GARAGE using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
