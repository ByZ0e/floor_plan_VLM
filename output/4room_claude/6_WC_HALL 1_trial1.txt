Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the connections and provide a navigation plan as requested.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER
D2: Connects CELLIER to PORCHE
D3: Connects PORCHE to HALL
D4: Connects HALL to WC
D5: Connects HALL to LINGERIE
D6: Connects HALL to BUREAU
D7: Connects HALL to BAINS
D8: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE PARENTS
D9: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
D10: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
D11: Connects CELLIER to HALL
D12: Connects HALL 1 to PORCHE1
D13: Connects GARAGE1 to CELLIER 1
D21: Connects CELLIER 1 to PORCHE1
D31: Connects PORCHE1 to HALL1
D41: Connects HALL1 to WC1
D51: Connects HALL1 to LINGERIE1
D61: Connects HALL1 to BUREAU1
D71: Connects HALL1 to BAINS1
D81: Connects HALL1 to CHAMBRE PARENTS1
D91: Connects HALL1 to CHAMBRE ENFANT 21
D101: Connects HALL1 to CHAMBRE ENFANT 11
D111: Connects CELLIER 1 to HALL 1

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in WC1
2. Use D41 to enter HALL1

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 41},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 41},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 41}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from WC1 to HALL1 using the shortest possible path and only the necessary doors.
