Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from CELLIER 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE 1.

Room and Door Connections:

D91: Connects CELLIER 1 and HALL 1
D11: Connects HALL 1 and BAINS 1
D21: Connects HALL 1 and WC 1
D31: Connects HALL 1 and CHAMBRE 4
D41: Connects HALL 1 and HALL 1 (different sections)
D51: Connects HALL 1 and CHAMBRE 3
D61: Connects HALL 1 and PORCHE 1
D71: Connects PORCHE 1 and CUISINE 1
D81: Connects CUISINE 1 and TERRASSE COUVERTE 1

Navigation Plan:

To get from CELLIER 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE 1, we need to follow this path:
CELLIER 1 -> HALL 1 -> PORCHE 1 -> CUISINE 1 -> TERRASSE COUVERTE 1

Here's the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D91"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D91"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D91"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D71"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D71"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D71"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D81"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D81"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D81"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CELLIER 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE 1 using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
