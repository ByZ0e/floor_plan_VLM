Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from DEGT 1 to DEGT.

Room and Door Connections:
D31: Connects SEJOUR1 and CUISINE1
D41: Connects SEJOUR1 and DEGT1
D51: Connects DEGT1 and CH.3
D61: Connects DEGT1 and CH.4
D71: Connects DEGT1 and BAINS1
D3: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
D5: Connects DEGT and CH.1
D6: Connects DEGT and CH.2
D7: Connects DEGT and BAINS
D8: Connects DEGT and WC
D9: Connects CH.2 and CH.4
D10: Connects CELLIER and CUISINE

Navigation Plan:
To go from DEGT 1 to DEGT, we need to use the following sequence of actions:

1. ApproachDoor(D41)
2. OpenDoor(D41)
3. GoThrough(D41)
4. ApproachDoor(D3)
5. OpenDoor(D3)
6. GoThrough(D3)
7. ApproachDoor(D4)
8. OpenDoor(D4)
9. GoThrough(D4)

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "DEGT 1",
  "end": "DEGT",
  "actions": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D41"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D41"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D41"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from DEGT 1 to DEGT using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
