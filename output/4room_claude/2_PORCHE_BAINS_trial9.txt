Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
1. Porche: Connected to Sejour via D1
2. Cellier: Connected to Cuisine via D2
3. Sejour: Connected to Porche via D1, to Cuisine via D3, to Degt via D4
4. Cuisine: Connected to Cellier via D2, to Sejour via D3
5. CH.1: Connected to Degt via D5
6. Degt: Connected to Sejour via D4, to CH.1 via D5, to CH.2 via D6, to WC via D7, to Bains via D8
7. CH.2: Connected to Degt via D6
8. WC: Connected to Degt via D7
9. Bains: Connected to Degt via D8

Navigation Plan:
1. Start in Porche
2. ApproachDoor(D1)
3. OpenDoor(D1)
4. GoThrough(D1) - Now in Sejour
5. ApproachDoor(D4)
6. OpenDoor(D4)
7. GoThrough(D4) - Now in Degt
8. ApproachDoor(D8)
9. OpenDoor(D8)
10. GoThrough(D8) - Now in Bains (destination reached)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"}
  ]
}
```

This path efficiently navigates from the Porche to the Bains using only the necessary doors and rooms.
