Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the GARAGE to the WC.

Room and Door Connections:
D9: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER
D1: Connects CELLIER and HALL
D2: Connects HALL and WC
D3: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 1
D4: Connects HALL and HALL (different sections)
D5: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 2
D6: Connects HALL and PORCHE
D7: Connects PORCHE and CUISINE
D8: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
D10: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE and TERRASSE COUVERTE (different sections)

Navigation Plan:
To go from the GARAGE to the WC, we need to use the following doors: D9, D1, and D2.

Here's the step-by-step navigation plan:

1. ApproachDoor(9)
2. OpenDoor(9)
3. GoThrough(9)
4. ApproachDoor(1)
5. OpenDoor(1)
6. GoThrough(1)
7. ApproachDoor(2)
8. OpenDoor(2)
9. GoThrough(2)

Now, I'll provide the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 9},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan will efficiently guide you from the GARAGE to the WC using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
