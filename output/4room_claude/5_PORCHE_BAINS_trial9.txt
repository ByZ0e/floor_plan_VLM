Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms and doors, create a list of connections, and then provide a navigation plan from PORCHE to BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects PORCHE to SEJOUR
2. D2: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
3. D3: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
4. D4: Connects SEJOUR to DEGT
5. D5: Connects DEGT to CH.1
6. D6: Connects DEGT to CH.2
7. D7: Connects DEGT to BAINS
8. D8: Connects DEGT to WC
9. D9: Connects CH.2 to CH.4
10. D10: Connects CELLIER to CUISINE

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in PORCHE
2. ApproachDoor(D1)
3. OpenDoor(D1)
4. GoThrough(D1) to enter SEJOUR
5. ApproachDoor(D4)
6. OpenDoor(D4)
7. GoThrough(D4) to enter DEGT
8. ApproachDoor(D7)
9. OpenDoor(D7)
10. GoThrough(D7) to enter BAINS

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan provides the most efficient route from PORCHE to BAINS, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
