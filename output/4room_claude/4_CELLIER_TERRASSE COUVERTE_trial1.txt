Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a detailed navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D9: Connects CELLIER and GARAGE
2. D1: Connects CELLIER and HALL
3. D2: Connects HALL and WC
4. D3: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 1
5. D4: Connects HALL and HALL
6. D5: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 2
7. D6: Connects HALL and PORCHE
8. D7: Connects PORCHE and CUISINE
9. D8: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
10. D10: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE and TERRASSE COUVERTE

Navigation Plan:
To go from CELLIER to TERRASSE COUVERTE, we need to follow these steps:

1. Start in CELLIER
2. Use D1 to enter HALL
3. Use D6 to enter PORCHE
4. Use D7 to enter CUISINE
5. Use D8 to reach TERRASSE COUVERTE

Here's the detailed action plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from CELLIER to TERRASSE COUVERTE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
