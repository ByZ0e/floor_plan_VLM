Thank you for providing the floor plan and instructions. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the PORCHE to the BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
1. PORCHE connects to SEJOUR via D1
2. SEJOUR connects to CUISINE via D3
3. CUISINE connects to CELLIER via D2
4. SEJOUR connects to DEGT via D4
5. DEGT connects to WC via D8
6. DEGT connects to CH.2 via D6
7. DEGT connects to BAINS via D7

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in PORCHE
2. Use D1 to enter SEJOUR
3. Use D4 to enter DEGT
4. Use D7 to enter BAINS

Now, I'll provide the detailed action sequence in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "doorNumber": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "doorNumber": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "doorNumber": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "doorNumber": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "doorNumber": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "doorNumber": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "doorNumber": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "doorNumber": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "doorNumber": 7}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan provides the most efficient route from the PORCHE to the BAINS using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
