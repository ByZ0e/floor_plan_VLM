Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. Let's start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections based on the image:

Room and Door Connections:
1. D9: Connects Cellier to Garage
2. D1: Connects Cellier to Hall
3. D2: Connects Hall to Bains
4. D3: Connects Hall to WC
5. D4: Connects Hall to Chambre 1
6. D5: Connects Hall to Chambre 2
7. D6: Connects Hall to Porche
8. D7: Connects Hall to Cuisine
9. D8: Connects Cuisine to Terrasse Couverte

Now, let's create a step-by-step navigation plan to go from the Garage to the WC:

1. ApproachDoor(D9)
2. OpenDoor(D9)
3. GoThrough(D9)
4. ApproachDoor(D1)
5. OpenDoor(D1)
6. GoThrough(D1)
7. ApproachDoor(D3)
8. OpenDoor(D3)
9. GoThrough(D3)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"}
  ]
}
```

This path takes you from the Garage through the Cellier and Hall to reach the WC, using only the necessary doors along the way.
