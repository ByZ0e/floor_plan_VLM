Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from the GARAGE to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1.

Explicit Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER
D2: Connects CELLIER to PORCHE
D3: Connects PORCHE to HALL
D4: Connects HALL to WC
D5: Connects HALL to LINGERIE
D6: Connects HALL to BUREAU
D7: Connects HALL to BAINS
D8: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE PARENTS
D9: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
D10: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
D11: Connects CELLIER to HALL

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in GARAGE
2. ApproachDoor(D1)
3. OpenDoor(D1)
4. GoThrough(D1) to enter CELLIER
5. ApproachDoor(D11)
6. OpenDoor(D11)
7. GoThrough(D11) to enter HALL
8. ApproachDoor(D10)
9. OpenDoor(D10)
10. GoThrough(D10) to enter CHAMBRE ENFANT 1

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D10"}
  ]
}
```

This path efficiently navigates from the GARAGE to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
