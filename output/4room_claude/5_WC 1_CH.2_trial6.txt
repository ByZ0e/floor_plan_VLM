Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and their door connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from WC 1 to CH.2.

Room and Door Connections:
1. WC 1 - D71 connects to DEGT 1
2. DEGT 1 - D61 connects to CH.4, D51 connects to SEJOUR 1
3. SEJOUR 1 - D41 connects to DEGT 1, D31 connects to CUISINE 1, D11 connects to Porche1
4. CUISINE 1 - D31 connects to SEJOUR 1, D21 connects to CELLIER 1
5. CELLIER 1 - D21 connects to CUISINE 1
6. Porche1 - D11 connects to SEJOUR 1
7. SEJOUR - D4 connects to DEGT, D3 connects to CUISINE, D1 connects to Porche
8. CUISINE - D3 connects to SEJOUR, D2 connects to CELLIER
9. CELLIER - D2 connects to CUISINE
10. Porche - D1 connects to SEJOUR
11. DEGT - D8 connects to WC, D6 connects to CH.2, D5 connects to CH.1, D4 connects to SEJOUR
12. WC - D8 connects to DEGT
13. CH.1 - D5 connects to DEGT
14. CH.2 - D6 connects to DEGT

Navigation Plan:
To go from WC 1 to CH.2, we need to cross through DEGT 1, SEJOUR 1, SEJOUR, and DEGT. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(D71)
2. OpenDoor(D71)
3. GoThrough(D71)
4. ApproachDoor(D51)
5. OpenDoor(D51)
6. GoThrough(D51)
7. ApproachDoor(D41)
8. OpenDoor(D41)
9. GoThrough(D41)
10. ApproachDoor(D4)
11. OpenDoor(D4)
12. GoThrough(D4)
13. ApproachDoor(D6)
14. OpenDoor(D6)
15. GoThrough(D6)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D71"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D71"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D71"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D51"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D51"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D51"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D41"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D41"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D41"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"}
  ]
}
```

This path will efficiently guide you from WC 1 to CH.2 using only the necessary doors and rooms.
