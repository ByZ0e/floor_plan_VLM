Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the WC to HALL 1.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER
D2: Connects CELLIER to PORCHE
D3: Connects PORCHE to HALL
D4: Connects HALL to WC
D5: Connects HALL to LINGERIE
D6: Connects HALL to BUREAU
D7: Connects HALL to BAINS
D8: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE PARENTS
D9: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
D10: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
D11: Connects CELLIER to HALL
D12: Connects HALL to PORCHE1 (upper floor)

For the navigation from WC to HALL 1, we only need to use one door:

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in WC
2. Approach and open door D4
3. Go through D4 to enter HALL 1

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "WC",
  "end": "HALL 1",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from the WC to HALL 1, using only the necessary door (D4) to complete the navigation task.
