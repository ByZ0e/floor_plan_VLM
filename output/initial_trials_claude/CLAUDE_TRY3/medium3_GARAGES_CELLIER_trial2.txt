Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide you with an efficient navigation plan from the GARAGES to the CELLIER.

Room and Door Descriptions:
- GARAGES: Connected to CELLIER via D1
- CELLIER: Connected to GARAGES via D1, to CUISINE via D3
- CUISINE: Connected to CELLIER via D3, to HALL via D6
- DOUCHE: Connected to HALL via D2
- WC: Connected to HALL via D4
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D5
- HALL: Central area connecting multiple rooms

After careful analysis, here's the most efficient path from GARAGES to CELLIER:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"}
  ]
}
```

This path is the most direct and efficient route from the GARAGES to the CELLIER. It only requires using one door (D1), which directly connects these two areas. There's no need to go through any other rooms or use any additional doors to reach the destination.
