Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan to get from CHAMBRE 1 to GARAGES.

Rooms and Doors:
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D5
- HALL: Central area connecting multiple rooms
- CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D6 and D7
- CELLIER: Connected to HALL via D3
- WC: Connected to HALL via D4
- DOUCHE: Connected to HALL via D2
- GARAGES: Connected to HALL via D1

Navigation Plan:
To get from CHAMBRE 1 to GARAGES, we need to go through the HALL. Here's the sequence of actions in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from CHAMBRE 1 to GARAGES using only the necessary doors. You'll start by exiting CHAMBRE 1 through D5 into the HALL, then proceed directly to D1 to enter the GARAGES area.
