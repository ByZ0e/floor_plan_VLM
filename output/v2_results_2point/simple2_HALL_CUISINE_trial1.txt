Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the HALL to the CUISINE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects HALL to BAINS
2. D2 connects HALL to CH.1
3. D3 connects HALL to CH.2
4. D4 connects HALL to GARAGE
5. D5 connects HALL to CUISINE

Based on these connections, here's the efficient navigation plan to get from the HALL to the CUISINE:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct route from the HALL to the CUISINE using only the necessary actions. The robot starts in the HALL, approaches door D5, opens it, and goes through to reach the CUISINE. No other doors or rooms need to be traversed for this particular navigation task.
