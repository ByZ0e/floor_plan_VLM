Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from CHAMBRE 2 to WC.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
D2: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to HALL
D3: Connects HALL to BAINS
D4: Connects HALL to WC
D5: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to HALL (near PORCHE)
D6: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
D7: Connects CUISINE to HALL
D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER

Navigation Plan from CHAMBRE 2 to WC:
Based on the room and door connections, here's the efficient navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan takes you from CHAMBRE 2 to the HALL through door D2, and then from the HALL to the WC through door D4. It's the most direct and efficient route based on the floor plan provided.
