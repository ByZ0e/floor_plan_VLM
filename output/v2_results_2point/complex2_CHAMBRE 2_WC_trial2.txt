Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from CHAMBRE 2 to WC.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to HALL
D2: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to HALL
D3: Connects HALL to BAINS
D4: Connects HALL to WC
D5: Connects HALL to PORCHE
D6: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE
D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER

Navigation Plan:
To go from CHAMBRE 2 to WC, we need to use doors D2 and D4. Here's the step-by-step plan:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CHAMBRE 2 to WC using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
