Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms, doors, and their connections, then provide a navigation plan from the WC to CHAMBRE 2.

Room and Door Connections:
1. WC connects to HALL through D3
2. HALL connects to CHAMBRE 1 through D2
3. HALL connects to BAINS through D4
4. HALL connects to CHAMBRE 3 through D5
5. HALL connects to CHAMBRE 2 through D6
6. HALL connects to CELLIER through D7
7. HALL connects to Porche through D8
8. GARAGE connects to CELLIER through D1

Based on these connections, here's the efficient navigation plan from WC to CHAMBRE 2:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct route from the WC to CHAMBRE 2, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours through other rooms.
