Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the connections and provide a navigation plan as requested.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to HALL
D2: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to HALL
D3: Connects HALL to BAINS
D4: Connects HALL to WC
D5: Connects HALL to PORCHE
D6: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE
D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER

Now, for the navigation task from CHAMBRE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE:

{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8}
  ]
}

This plan provides the most efficient path from CHAMBRE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE using only the necessary doors. The robot will exit CHAMBRE 1 through D6, enter the HALL, then go through D7 to enter the CUISINE, and finally use D8 to reach the TERRASSE COUVERTE.
