Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the CUISINE to CH.1.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:
D1: Connects BAINS to HALL
D2: Connects CH.1 to HALL
D3: Connects CH.2 to HALL
D4: Connects GARAGE to CUISINE
D5: Connects CUISINE to HALL

Navigation Plan:
To navigate from CUISINE to CH.1, we need to use doors D5 and D2. Here's the step-by-step plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently guide you from the CUISINE to CH.1 using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
