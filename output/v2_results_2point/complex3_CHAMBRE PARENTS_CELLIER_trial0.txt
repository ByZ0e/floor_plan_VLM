Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the connections and provide a navigation plan as requested.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects Garage to Cellier
D2: Connects Cellier to Hall
D3: Connects Hall to Porche
D4: Connects Hall to WC
D5: Connects Hall to Lingerie
D6: Connects Hall to Bureau
D7: Connects Hall to Bains
D8: Connects Hall to Chambre Parents
D9: Connects Hall to Chambre Enfant 2
D10: Connects Hall to Chambre Enfant 1
D11: Connects Cellier to Hall

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan from Chambre Parents to Cellier:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from Chambre Parents to Cellier using the necessary doors. It avoids any unnecessary detours or extra steps.
