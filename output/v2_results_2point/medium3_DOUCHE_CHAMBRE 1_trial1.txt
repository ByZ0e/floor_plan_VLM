Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the connections and provide a navigation plan as requested.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects GARAGES to CELLIER
D2: Connects GARAGES to DOUCHE
D3: Connects CELLIER to CUISINE
D4: Connects WC to HALL
D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
D6: Connects HALL to CUISINE
D7: Connects CUISINE to HALL

Now, I'll create a step-by-step navigation plan from DOUCHE to CHAMBRE 1:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from DOUCHE to CHAMBRE 1 using the necessary doors. The robot starts in DOUCHE, goes through D2 to enter the GARAGES area, then approaches and goes through D5 to reach CHAMBRE 1. This is the most direct path based on the provided floor plan and door connections.
