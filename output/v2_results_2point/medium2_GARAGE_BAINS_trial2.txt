Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the connections and provide a navigation plan as requested.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects GARAGE to HALL
D2: Connects CHAMBRE1 to HALL
D3: Connects HALL to WC
D4: Connects HALL to BAINS
D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE3
D6: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE2
D7: Connects CELLIER to HALL
D8: Connects HALL to Porche

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan to go from the GARAGE to BAINS:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the GARAGE to BAINS using the necessary doors. It avoids any unnecessary rooms or doors, providing a direct path to the destination.
