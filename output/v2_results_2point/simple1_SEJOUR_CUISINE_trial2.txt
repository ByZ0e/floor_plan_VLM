Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the SEJOUR to the CUISINE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. SEJOUR (large central area) - connected to CH.3 via D1, CH.2 via D2, CH.1 via D4, and CUISINE via D6
2. CH.3 - connected to SEJOUR via D1
3. CH.2 - connected to SEJOUR via D2
4. CH.1 - connected to SEJOUR via D4
5. CUISINE - connected to SEJOUR via D6 and D5

Navigation Plan:
To go from SEJOUR to CUISINE, we only need to use one door: D6.

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 6
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 6
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 6
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from the SEJOUR to the CUISINE using only the necessary door (D6) for traversal.
