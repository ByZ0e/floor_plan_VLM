Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the CUISINE to the DOUCHE.

Rooms and Doors:
1. CUISINE (large central area)
2. TERRASSE COUVERTE
3. CELLIER
4. CH. PARENTS (two rooms)
5. DOUCHE

Doors:
D1: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
D2: Connects CUISINE and CELLIER
D3: Connects CUISINE and CH. PARENTS
D4: Connects CH. PARENTS and DOUCHE

Door-Room Connections:
- D1: CUISINE <-> TERRASSE COUVERTE
- D2: CUISINE <-> CELLIER
- D3: CUISINE <-> CH. PARENTS
- D4: CH. PARENTS <-> DOUCHE

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan from CUISINE to DOUCHE:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the CUISINE to the DOUCHE using the necessary doors (D3 and D4) without any unnecessary steps or detours.
