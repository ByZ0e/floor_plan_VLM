Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the connections and provide you with a navigation plan as requested.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:
- D1: Connects GARAGE to HALL
- D2: Connects CHAMBRE 1 to HALL
- D3: Connects CHAMBRE 1 to HALL (near WC)
- D4: Connects BAINS to HALL
- D5: Connects CHAMBRE 3 to HALL
- D6: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to HALL
- D7: Connects CELLIER to HALL
- D8: Connects HALL to Porche

For the navigation task from CHAMBRE 1 to HALL, we only need to use one door. Here's the efficient navigation plan:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently take you from CHAMBRE 1 to the HALL using the most direct route. You'll approach door D2, open it, and go through it to enter the HALL. No other doors or rooms need to be traversed for this particular navigation task.
