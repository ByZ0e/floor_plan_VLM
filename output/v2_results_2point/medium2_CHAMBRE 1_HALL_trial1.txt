Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the room and door connections, then provide a navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
- CHAMBRE 1 <-> D2 <-> HALL
- GARAGE <-> D1 <-> CELLIER
- CELLIER <-> D7 <-> HALL
- BAINS <-> D4 <-> HALL
- WC <-> D3 <-> HALL
- CHAMBRE 3 <-> D5 <-> HALL
- CHAMBRE 2 <-> D6 <-> HALL
- HALL <-> D8 <-> Porche

Navigation Plan:
To go from CHAMBRE 1 to HALL, we only need to use one door: D2.

Here's the step-by-step navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from CHAMBRE 1 to HALL using the most direct path available according to the floor plan.
