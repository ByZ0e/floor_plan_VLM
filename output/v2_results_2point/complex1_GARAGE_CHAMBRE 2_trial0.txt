Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the connections and provide you with a navigation plan as requested.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
D2: Connects BAINS to HALL
D3: Connects WC to HALL
D4: Connects CHAMBRE 1 to HALL
D5: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to HALL
D6: Connects PORCHE to HALL
D7: Connects CUISINE to HALL
D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE

Now, let's create the navigation plan from GARAGE to CHAMBRE 2:

{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 9},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5}
  ]
}

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the GARAGE to CHAMBRE 2 using only the necessary doors. The path goes through the CELLIER and HALL before reaching the final destination. Each step is carefully considered to ensure the correct and most direct route based on the provided floor plan.
