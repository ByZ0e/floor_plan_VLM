Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan to get from CH.1 to CH.2.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CH.1 connects to SEJOUR through D4
2. CH.2 connects to SEJOUR through D3
3. CH.3 connects to SEJOUR through D2
4. CH.3 also connects to another SEJOUR area through D1
5. CUISINE connects to SEJOUR through D5 and D6

Navigation Plan:
To go from CH.1 to CH.2, we need to go through the SEJOUR area. Here's the step-by-step plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently take you from CH.1 to CH.2 using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
