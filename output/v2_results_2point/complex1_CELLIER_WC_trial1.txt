Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan to go from the CELLIER to the WC.

Explicit Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
D2: Connects HALL to BAINS
D3: Connects HALL to WC
D4: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 2
D6: Connects HALL to PORCHE
D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE
D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE

Now, for the navigation plan from CELLIER to WC:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the CELLIER to the WC using only the necessary doors. It starts by exiting the CELLIER through D1 into the HALL, then immediately proceeds to D3 to enter the WC, which is the final destination.
