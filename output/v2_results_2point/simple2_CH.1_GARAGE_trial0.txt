Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from CH.1 to the GARAGE.

Room and Door Connections:
- CH.1 connects to HALL through D2
- BAINS connects to HALL through D1
- CH.2 connects to HALL through D3
- GARAGE connects to HALL and CUISINE through D4
- CUISINE connects to HALL through D5

Now, for the navigation plan from CH.1 to GARAGE:

1. Start in CH.1
2. Use D2 to enter the HALL
3. Move through the HALL
4. Use D4 to enter the GARAGE

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CH.1",
  "end": "GARAGE",
  "path": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 2
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 2
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 2
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 4
    }
  ]
}
```

This path efficiently navigates from CH.1 to the GARAGE using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
