Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the GARAGES to the CELLIER.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects GARAGES to CELLIER
D2: Connects GARAGES to DOUCHE
D3: Connects CELLIER to CUISINE
D4: Connects WC to HALL
D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
D6: Connects HALL to CUISINE
D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE (second instance)

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan from GARAGES to CELLIER:

{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 1
    }
  ]
}

This plan provides the most direct and efficient path from the GARAGES to the CELLIER. It involves only one door (D1), which directly connects these two areas. The robot will approach D1, open it, and go through to reach the CELLIER.
