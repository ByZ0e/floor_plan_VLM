Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms and doors, create a list of connections, and then provide a navigation plan from SEJOUR to CH.1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
2. D2 connects CUISINE to CELLIER
3. D3 connects CUISINE to SEJOUR
4. D4 connects SEJOUR to DEGT
5. D5 connects DEGT to CH.1
6. D6 connects DEGT to CH.2
7. D7 connects DEGT to BAINS
8. D8 connects CUISINE to WC

Now, for the navigation plan from SEJOUR to CH.1:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5}
  ]
}
```

This plan takes you from SEJOUR to CH.1 using the most direct route available. You'll first go through D4 to enter DEGT, and then through D5 to reach CH.1. This path avoids any unnecessary doors or rooms, providing an efficient route to your destination.
