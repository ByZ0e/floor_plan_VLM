Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms and doors, create a list of connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the CELLIER to the CH. PARENTS.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

1. D1: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE to CUISINE
2. D2: Connects CELLIER to CUISINE
3. D3: Connects CUISINE to CH. PARENTS
4. D4: Connects CH. PARENTS to DOUCHE

Based on these connections, here's the navigation plan from CELLIER to CH. PARENTS:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the CELLIER to the CH. PARENTS using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
