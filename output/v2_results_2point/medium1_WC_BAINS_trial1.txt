Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the WC to the BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
1. WC connects to DEGT via D8
2. DEGT connects to CH.2 via D6
3. DEGT connects to SEJOUR via D4
4. SEJOUR connects to CUISINE via D3
5. SEJOUR connects to Porche via D1
6. CUISINE connects to CELLIER via D2
7. BAINS connects to DEGT via D7

Now, let's create the navigation plan from WC to BAINS:

{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7}
  ]
}

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the WC to the BAINS using the shortest path available based on the floor plan provided. The plan avoids unnecessary doors and rooms, focusing only on the required path to reach the destination.
