Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and their door connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the CUISINE to CHAMBRE 1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D7, to TERRASSE COUVERTE via D8
2. HALL: Connected to CUISINE via D7, to CHAMBRE 1 via D4, to CHAMBRE 2 via D5, to BAINS via D2, to WC via D3, to CELLIER via D1
3. CELLIER: Connected to HALL via D1, to GARAGE via D9
4. GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER via D9
5. CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL via D5
6. CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D4
7. BAINS: Connected to HALL via D2
8. WC: Connected to HALL via D3
9. TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE via D8
10. PORCHE: Connected to HALL via D6

Now, for the navigation plan from CUISINE to CHAMBRE 1:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the CUISINE to CHAMBRE 1 using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
