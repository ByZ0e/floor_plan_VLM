Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from CHAMBRE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
- D2: Connects BAINS to HALL
- D3: Connects WC to HALL
- D4: Connects CHAMBRE 1 to HALL
- D5: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to HALL
- D6: Connects HALL to PORCHE
- D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE
- D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
- D9: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan from CHAMBRE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from CHAMBRE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
