Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the room and door connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the CELLIER to CH. PARENTS.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE to CUISINE
2. D2: Connects CELLIER to CUISINE
3. D3: Connects CUISINE to CH. PARENTS
4. D4: Connects CH. PARENTS to DOUCHE

Navigation Plan:
To go from CELLIER to CH. PARENTS, we need to use doors D2 and D3. Here's the step-by-step plan:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently guide you from the CELLIER to CH. PARENTS using only the necessary doors (D2 and D3) and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
