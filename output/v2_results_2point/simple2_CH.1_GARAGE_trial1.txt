Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan from CH.1 to the GARAGE.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

Rooms:
- CH.1
- CH.2
- BAINS
- GARAGE
- CUISINE
- HALL (multiple instances connecting rooms)

Doors and their connections:
D1: Connects CH.1 to HALL
D2: Connects CH.1 to HALL
D3: Connects CH.2 to HALL
D4: Connects GARAGE to CUISINE
D5: Connects CUISINE to HALL

Navigation Plan:

To get from CH.1 to GARAGE, we need to use doors D2 and D4. Here's the step-by-step navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently guide you from CH.1 to the GARAGE using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
