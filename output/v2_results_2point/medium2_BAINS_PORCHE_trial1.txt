Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the connections and provide a navigation plan as requested.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects Garage to Hall
D2: Connects Chambre 1 to Hall
D3: Connects Hall to WC
D4: Connects Bains to Hall
D5: Connects Hall to Chambre 3
D6: Connects Hall to Chambre 2
D7: Connects Hall to Cellier
D8: Connects Hall to Porche

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan from Bains to Porche:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from Bains to Porche using only the necessary doors. The robot starts in Bains, goes through D4 to enter the Hall, and then proceeds through D8 to reach the Porche. This is the most direct route based on the floor plan provided.
