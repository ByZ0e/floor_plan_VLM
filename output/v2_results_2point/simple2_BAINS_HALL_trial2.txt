Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the BAINS to the HALL.

Room and Door Connections:
1. BAINS: Connected to HALL via D1
2. CH.1: Connected to HALL via D2
3. CH.2: Connected to HALL via D3
4. GARAGE: Connected to CUISINE via D4
5. CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D5

Now, for the navigation plan from BAINS to HALL:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently take you from the BAINS to the HALL using the most direct route. You'll approach D1, which connects the BAINS to the HALL, open it, and go through it. Once you've completed these steps, you'll be in the HALL, which is your destination.
