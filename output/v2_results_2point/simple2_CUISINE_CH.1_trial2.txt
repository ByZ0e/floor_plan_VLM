Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms and doors, create a list of connections, and then provide a navigation plan from CUISINE to CH.1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects BAINS to HALL
2. D2 connects CH.1 to HALL
3. D3 connects CH.2 to HALL
4. D4 connects GARAGE to CUISINE
5. D5 connects CUISINE to HALL

Navigation Plan:
To go from CUISINE to CH.1, we need to use doors D5 and D2. Here's the detailed plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the CUISINE to CH.1 using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
