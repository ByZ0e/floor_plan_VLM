Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the room and door connections, then provide a navigation plan from CHAMBRE 1 to the HALL.

Explicit Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects GARAGE to HALL
- D2: Connects CHAMBRE 1 to HALL
- D3: Connects CHAMBRE 1 to HALL
- D4: Connects BAINS to HALL
- D5: Connects CHAMBRE 3 to HALL
- D6: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to HALL
- D7: Connects CELLIER to HALL
- D8: Connects HALL to Porche

Now, for the navigation plan from CHAMBRE 1 to HALL:

The most efficient path is to use door D2, which directly connects CHAMBRE 1 to the HALL. Here's the step-by-step navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D2"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D2"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D2"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates you from CHAMBRE 1 to the HALL using the most direct route available. No unnecessary doors or rooms are included in the path.
