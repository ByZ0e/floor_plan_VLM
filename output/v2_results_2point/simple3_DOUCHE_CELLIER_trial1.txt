Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms and doors, create a list of connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the DOUCHE to the CELLIER.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE and CUISINE
2. D2: Connects CUISINE and CELLIER
3. D3: Connects CUISINE and CH. PARENTS
4. D4: Connects CH. PARENTS and DOUCHE

Navigation Plan:
To go from DOUCHE to CELLIER, we need to pass through CH. PARENTS and CUISINE. Here's the step-by-step plan:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the DOUCHE to the CELLIER using the necessary doors and passing through the required rooms.
