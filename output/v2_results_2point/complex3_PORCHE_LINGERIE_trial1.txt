Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the PORCHE to the LINGERIE.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER
- D2: Connects CELLIER to PORCHE
- D3: Connects PORCHE to HALL
- D4: Connects HALL to WC
- D5: Connects HALL to LINGERIE
- D6: Connects HALL to BUREAU
- D7: Connects HALL to BAINS
- D8: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE PARENTS
- D9: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
- D10: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
- D11: Connects CELLIER to HALL

Navigation Plan:
To go from the PORCHE to the LINGERIE, we need to use doors D3 and D5. Here's the step-by-step plan:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the PORCHE to the LINGERIE using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
