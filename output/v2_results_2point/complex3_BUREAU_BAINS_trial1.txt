Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the BUREAU to the BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER
2. D2: Connects CELLIER and PORCHE
3. D3: Connects PORCHE and HALL
4. D4: Connects HALL and WC
5. D5: Connects HALL and LINGERIE
6. D6: Connects HALL and BUREAU
7. D7: Connects HALL and BAINS
8. D8: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE PARENTS
9. D9: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
10. D10: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
11. D11: Connects CELLIER and HALL

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan from BUREAU to BAINS:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the BUREAU to the BAINS using only the necessary doors. The robot will exit the BUREAU through door D6, enter the HALL, and then enter the BAINS through door D7. This is the most direct path based on the provided floor plan.
