Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and their door connections, then provide the navigation plan from CH.3 to CH.1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CH.3 - connected to SEJOUR through D1 and D2
2. CH.2 - connected to SEJOUR through D2 and D3
3. CH.1 - connected to SEJOUR through D4
4. SEJOUR - connected to CH.3 through D1 and D2, to CH.2 through D2 and D3, to CH.1 through D4, and to CUISINE through D6
5. CUISINE - connected to SEJOUR through D6

Navigation Plan from CH.3 to CH.1:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CH.3 to CH.1 using the minimum number of necessary doors. The robot starts in CH.3, goes through D1 to enter the SEJOUR, and then uses D4 to reach CH.1, which is the final destination.
