Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms, doors, and their connections, then provide a navigation plan from the GARAGE to the BAINS.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects GARAGE to HALL
D2: Connects CHAMBRE1 to HALL
D3: Connects HALL to WC
D4: Connects HALL to BAINS
D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE3
D6: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE2
D7: Connects CELLIER to HALL
D8: Connects HALL to Porche

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan from the GARAGE to the BAINS:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from the GARAGE to the BAINS, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours. The robot will exit the GARAGE through D1, enter the HALL, and then proceed directly to the BAINS through D4.
