Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms and doors, create a list of connections, and then provide a navigation plan from CH. PARENTS to TERRASSE COUVERTE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
2. D2 connects CUISINE to CELLIER
3. D3 connects CUISINE to CH. PARENTS
4. D4 connects CH. PARENTS to DOUCHE

Navigation Plan:
To go from CH. PARENTS to TERRASSE COUVERTE, we need to use doors D3 and D1. Here's the detailed plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently guide you from CH. PARENTS to TERRASSE COUVERTE using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
