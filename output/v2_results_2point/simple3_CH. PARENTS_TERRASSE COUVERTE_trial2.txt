Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from CH. PARENTS to TERRASSE COUVERTE.

Rooms and Doors with Connections:

1. CH. PARENTS: Connected to CUISINE via D3
2. CUISINE: Connected to CH. PARENTS via D3, to CELLIER via D2, and to TERRASSE COUVERTE via D1
3. CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE via D2
4. TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE via D1
5. DOUCHE: Connected to CUISINE via D4

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CH. PARENTS",
  "end": "TERRASSE COUVERTE",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from CH. PARENTS to TERRASSE COUVERTE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
