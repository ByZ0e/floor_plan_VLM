Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the CELLIER to the WC.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CELLIER - connected to CUISINE via D2
2. CUISINE - connected to CELLIER via D2, to SEJOUR via D3
3. SEJOUR - connected to CUISINE via D3, to DEGT via D4
4. DEGT - connected to SEJOUR via D4, to CH.2 via D6, to WC via D8
5. CH.2 - connected to DEGT via D6
6. WC - connected to DEGT via D8

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan from CELLIER to WC:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan will efficiently guide you from the CELLIER to the WC using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
