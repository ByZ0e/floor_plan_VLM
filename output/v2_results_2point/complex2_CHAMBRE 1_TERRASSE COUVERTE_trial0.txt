Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms and doors, create a list of connections, and then provide a navigation plan from CHAMBRE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects CELLIER and HALL
D2: Connects CHAMBRE 2 and HALL
D3: Connects HALL and BAINS
D4: Connects HALL and WC
D5: Connects HALL and PORCHE
D6: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 1
D7: Connects HALL and CUISINE
D8: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER

Navigation Plan:
To go from CHAMBRE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE, we need to use the following doors: D6, D7, and D8.

Here's the step-by-step navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from CHAMBRE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
