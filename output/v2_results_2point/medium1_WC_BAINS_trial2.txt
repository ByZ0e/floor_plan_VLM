Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the WC to the BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects SEJOUR and Porche
2. D2 connects CUISINE and CELLIER
3. D3 connects CUISINE and SEJOUR
4. D4 connects SEJOUR and DEGT
5. D5 connects CH.1 and DEGT
6. D6 connects CH.2 and DEGT
7. D7 connects BAINS and DEGT
8. D8 connects WC and DEGT

Now, for the navigation plan from WC to BAINS:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the WC to the BAINS using only the necessary doors. The robot starts in the WC, goes through D8 to enter the DEGT (dégagement or hallway), and then through D7 to reach the BAINS. This is the most direct and efficient path based on the floor plan provided.
