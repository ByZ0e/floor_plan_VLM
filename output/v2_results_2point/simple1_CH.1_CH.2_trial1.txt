Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from CH.1 to CH.2.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CH.1 - connected to SEJOUR via D4
2. CH.2 - connected to SEJOUR via D3
3. CH.3 - connected to SEJOUR via D2 and to another SEJOUR via D1
4. CUISINE - connected to SEJOUR via D5 and D6

Navigation Plan:
To go from CH.1 to CH.2, we need to go through the SEJOUR area. Here's the step-by-step plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from CH.1 to CH.2 using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
