Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from CH.2 to SEJOUR.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CH.3 connects to SEJOUR through D1
2. CH.2 connects to CH.3 through D2
3. CH.2 connects to SEJOUR through D3
4. CH.1 connects to SEJOUR through D4
5. CUISINE connects to SEJOUR through D5 and D6

Now, for the navigation plan from CH.2 to SEJOUR:

The most direct path from CH.2 to SEJOUR is through door D3. Here's the step-by-step navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CH.2",
  "end": "SEJOUR",
  "path": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 3
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from CH.2 to SEJOUR using only the necessary door (D3) that directly connects these two rooms.
