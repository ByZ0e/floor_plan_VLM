Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms and doors, create a list of connections, and then provide a navigation plan from DEGT to PORCHE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects SEJOUR to PORCHE
2. D2 connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
3. D3 connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
4. D4 connects SEJOUR to DEGT
5. D5 connects CH.1 to DEGT
6. D6 connects CH.2 to DEGT
7. D7 connects BAINS to DEGT
8. D8 connects WC to DEGT

Now, let's create the navigation plan from DEGT to PORCHE:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from DEGT to PORCHE. Here's a breakdown of the actions:

1. Start in DEGT
2. Approach door D4, which connects DEGT to SEJOUR
3. Open door D4
4. Go through door D4 to enter SEJOUR
5. Approach door D1, which connects SEJOUR to PORCHE
6. Open door D1
7. Go through door D1 to reach the PORCHE

This route uses only the necessary doors and rooms to reach the destination, avoiding any unnecessary detours or actions.
