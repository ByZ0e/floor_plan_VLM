Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms and doors, create a list of connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the CUISINE to CH.2.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects SEJOUR and Porche
2. D2 connects CUISINE and CELLIER
3. D3 connects CUISINE and SEJOUR
4. D4 connects SEJOUR and DEGT
5. D5 connects DEGT and CH.1
6. D6 connects DEGT and CH.2
7. D7 connects DEGT and BAINS
8. D8 connects CUISINE and WC

Based on these connections, here's the efficient navigation plan from CUISINE to CH.2:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6}
  ]
}
```

This plan takes you from the CUISINE through the SEJOUR and DEGT to reach CH.2, using only the necessary doors for the most efficient path.
