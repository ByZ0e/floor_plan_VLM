Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects GARAGES and CELLIER
- D2: Connects GARAGES and HALL (near DOUCHE)
- D3: Connects CELLIER and CUISINE
- D4: Connects WC and HALL
- D5: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 1
- D6: Connects HALL and CUISINE
- D7: Connects CUISINE and HALL (lower part)

Now, for the navigation plan from CHAMBRE 1 to GARAGES:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from CHAMBRE 1 to GARAGES, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours or rooms.
