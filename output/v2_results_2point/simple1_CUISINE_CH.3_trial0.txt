Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the CUISINE to CH.3.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects SEJOUR to CH.3
2. D2 connects CH.3 to CH.2
3. D3 connects CH.2 to SEJOUR
4. D4 connects SEJOUR to CH.1
5. D5 connects CUISINE to SEJOUR
6. D6 connects SEJOUR to SEJOUR (different areas of the same large room)

Now, let's create the navigation plan from CUISINE to CH.3:

```json
{
  "start": "CUISINE",
  "end": "CH.3",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the CUISINE to CH.3 using the following steps:
1. From CUISINE, approach and go through D5 to enter SEJOUR.
2. In SEJOUR, approach and go through D1 to enter CH.3.

This is the most direct path based on the floor plan provided, avoiding any unnecessary doors or rooms.
