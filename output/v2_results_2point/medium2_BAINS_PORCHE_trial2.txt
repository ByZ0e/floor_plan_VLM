Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the room and door connections, then provide a navigation plan from BAINS to PORCHE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects GARAGE to HALL
2. D2: Connects CHAMBRE1 to HALL
3. D3: Connects WC to HALL
4. D4: Connects BAINS to HALL
5. D5: Connects CHAMBRE3 to HALL
6. D6: Connects CHAMBRE2 to HALL
7. D7: Connects CELLIER to HALL
8. D8: Connects HALL to PORCHE

Based on these connections, here's the efficient navigation plan from BAINS to PORCHE:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from BAINS to PORCHE using only the necessary doors. It avoids any unnecessary rooms or doors, providing a direct path to the destination.
