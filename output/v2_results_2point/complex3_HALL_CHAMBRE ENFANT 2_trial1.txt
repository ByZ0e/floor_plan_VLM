Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the connections and provide a navigation plan as requested.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER
D2: Connects CELLIER to PORCHE
D3: Connects PORCHE to HALL
D4: Connects HALL to WC
D5: Connects HALL to LINGERIE
D6: Connects HALL to BUREAU
D7: Connects HALL to BAINS
D8: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE PARENTS
D9: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
D10: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
D11: Connects CELLIER to HALL

Navigation Plan:
To navigate from the HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2, we only need to use one door: D9.

Here's the step-by-step navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "doorNumber": 9
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "doorNumber": 9
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "doorNumber": 9
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently guide you from the HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2 using only the necessary door (D9) without passing through any unnecessary rooms or doors.
