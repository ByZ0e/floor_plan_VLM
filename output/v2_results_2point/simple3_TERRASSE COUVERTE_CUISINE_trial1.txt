Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms and doors, create a list of connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to the CUISINE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. TERRASSE COUVERTE <-> D1 <-> CUISINE
2. CUISINE <-> D2 <-> CELLIER
3. CUISINE <-> D3 <-> CH. PARENTS
4. CH. PARENTS <-> D4 <-> DOUCHE

Navigation Plan:
To get from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to the CUISINE, we only need to use one door (D1). Here's the step-by-step plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to the CUISINE using the most direct path available. No unnecessary doors or rooms are included in this plan.
