Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms, doors, and their connections, then provide a navigation plan from the GARAGE to CH.2.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

1. D1 connects BAINS to HALL
2. D2 connects CH.1 to HALL
3. D3 connects CH.2 to HALL
4. D4 connects GARAGE to CUISINE
5. D5 connects CUISINE to HALL

Now, I'll create a step-by-step navigation plan based on these connections:

{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the GARAGE to CH.2 using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
