Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects GARAGES and CELLIER
- D2: Connects GARAGES and DOUCHE
- D3: Connects CELLIER and CUISINE
- D4: Connects WC and HALL
- D5: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 1
- D6: Connects HALL and CUISINE
- D7: Connects CUISINE and HALL

Now, for the navigation plan from CHAMBRE 1 to GARAGES:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from CHAMBRE 1 to GARAGES using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours. The path goes through CHAMBRE 1 > HALL > CUISINE > CELLIER > GARAGES, which is the most direct route based on the floor plan provided.
