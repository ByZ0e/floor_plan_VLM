Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from CH.1 to the GARAGE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects CH.1 to HALL
2. D2 connects CH.1 to HALL
3. D3 connects CH.2 to HALL
4. D4 connects GARAGE to CUISINE
5. D5 connects CUISINE to HALL

Now, let's create the navigation plan from CH.1 to GARAGE:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from CH.1 to the GARAGE:
1. Start in CH.1
2. Use D2 to enter the HALL
3. Move through the HALL to D4
4. Use D4 to enter the GARAGE

This route avoids unnecessary detours and uses the minimum number of doors required to reach the destination.
