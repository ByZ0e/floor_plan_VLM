Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a detailed navigation plan as requested.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

Rooms:
1. CUISINE (multiple areas)
2. CELLIER
3. TERRASSE COUVERTE
4. CH. PARENTS (two rooms)
5. DOUCHE

Doors and their connections:
D1: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
D2: Connects CUISINE to CELLIER
D3: Connects CUISINE to CH. PARENTS
D4: Connects CH. PARENTS to DOUCHE

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan to go from CUISINE to DOUCHE:

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CUISINE
2. Approach door D3
3. Open door D3
4. Go through door D3 to enter CH. PARENTS
5. Approach door D4
6. Open door D4
7. Go through door D4 to enter DOUCHE

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from CUISINE to DOUCHE, using only the necessary doors (D3 and D4) and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
