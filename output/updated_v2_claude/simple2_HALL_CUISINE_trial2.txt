Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the HALL to the CUISINE.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:
1. D1 connects HALL to BAINS
2. D2 connects HALL to CH.1
3. D3 connects HALL to CH.2
4. D4 connects HALL to GARAGE
5. D5 connects HALL to CUISINE

Based on these connections, here's the step-by-step navigation plan to go from HALL to CUISINE:

1. Start in the HALL
2. ApproachDoor(5)
3. OpenDoor(5)
4. GoThrough(5)

This is the most direct and efficient path from the HALL to the CUISINE according to the floor plan.

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(5)",
    "OpenDoor(5)",
    "GoThrough(5)"
  ]
}
```

This plan ensures that you'll reach the CUISINE from the HALL using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or actions.
