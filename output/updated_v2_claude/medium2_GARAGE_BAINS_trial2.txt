Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms, doors, and their connections, then provide a navigation plan from the GARAGE to the BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
1. GARAGE - D1 - HALL
2. HALL - D2 - CHAMBRE 1
3. HALL - D3 - WC
4. HALL - D4 - BAINS
5. HALL - D5 - CHAMBRE 3
6. HALL - D6 - CHAMBRE 2
7. HALL - D7 - CELLIER
8. HALL - D8 - Porche

Navigation Plan:
To go from the GARAGE to the BAINS, we need to use doors D1 and D4. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(1)
2. OpenDoor(1)
3. GoThrough(1)
4. ApproachDoor(4)
5. OpenDoor(4)
6. GoThrough(4)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates you from the GARAGE to the BAINS using only the necessary doors (D1 and D4) and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
