Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the CELLIER to the WC.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
2. D2: Connects HALL to BAINS
3. D3: Connects HALL to WC
4. D4: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
5. D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 2
6. D6: Connects HALL to PORCHE
7. D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE
8. D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
9. D9: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in CELLIER
2. Use D1 to enter HALL
3. Use D3 to enter WC

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the CELLIER to the WC, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
