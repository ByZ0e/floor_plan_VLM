Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and their door connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from CHAMBRE 2 to WC.

Room and Door Connections:
1. GARAGE - D9 to CELLIER
2. CELLIER - D9 to GARAGE, D1 to HALL
3. CHAMBRE 2 - D2 to HALL
4. HALL - D1 to CELLIER, D2 to CHAMBRE 2, D3 to BAINS, D4 to WC, D5 to PORCHE, D6 to CHAMBRE 1, D7 to CUISINE
5. BAINS - D3 to HALL
6. WC - D4 to HALL
7. PORCHE - D5 to HALL
8. CHAMBRE 1 - D6 to HALL
9. CUISINE - D7 to HALL, D8 to TERRASSE COUVERTE
10. TERRASSE COUVERTE - D8 to CUISINE

Navigation Plan:
Starting from CHAMBRE 2, we need to go through the HALL to reach the WC. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(D2)
2. OpenDoor(D2)
3. GoThrough(D2)
4. ApproachDoor(D4)
5. OpenDoor(D4)
6. GoThrough(D4)

Now, I'll provide the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CHAMBRE 2",
  "end": "WC",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CHAMBRE 2 to WC using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
