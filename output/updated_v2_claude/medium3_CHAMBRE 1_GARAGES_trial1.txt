Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from CHAMBRE 1 to GARAGES.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects GARAGES to CELLIER
- D2: Connects GARAGES to DOUCHE
- D3: Connects CELLIER to CUISINE
- D4: Connects WC to HALL
- D5: Connects CHAMBRE 1 to HALL
- D6: Connects CUISINE to HALL
- D7: Connects CUISINE to HALL

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in CHAMBRE 1
2. Use D5 to enter the HALL
3. Move through the HALL to D6
4. Use D6 to enter the CUISINE
5. Use D3 to enter the CELLIER
6. Use D1 to enter the GARAGES

Now, I'll provide the action sequence in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan will efficiently guide you from CHAMBRE 1 to GARAGES using only the necessary doors and rooms.
