Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the GARAGE to the BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D9: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER
2. D1: Connects CELLIER and HALL
3. D2: Connects CHAMBRE 2 and HALL
4. D5: Connects PORCHE and HALL
5. D7: Connects CUISINE and HALL
6. D8: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
7. D6: Connects CHAMBRE 1 and HALL
8. D4: Connects WC and HALL
9. D3: Connects BAINS and HALL

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in GARAGE
2. ApproachDoor(D9)
3. OpenDoor(D9)
4. GoThrough(D9) to enter CELLIER
5. ApproachDoor(D1)
6. OpenDoor(D1)
7. GoThrough(D1) to enter HALL
8. ApproachDoor(D3)
9. OpenDoor(D3)
10. GoThrough(D3) to enter BAINS

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the GARAGE to the BAINS, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
