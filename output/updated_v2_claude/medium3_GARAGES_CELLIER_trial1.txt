Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from the GARAGES to the CELLIER.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects GARAGES to CELLIER
2. D2: Connects GARAGES to DOUCHE
3. D3: Connects CELLIER to CUISINE
4. D4: Connects WC to HALL
5. D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
6. D6: Connects HALL to CUISINE
7. D7: Connects CUISINE to HALL

For the navigation task from GARAGES to CELLIER, we only need to use one door: D1.

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. ApproachDoor(1)
2. OpenDoor(1)
3. GoThrough(1)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This is the most efficient path from the GARAGES to the CELLIER, using only the necessary door (D1) that directly connects these two areas.
