Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1 connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
- D2 connects CUISINE and CELLIER
- D3 connects CUISINE and SEJOUR
- D4 connects SEJOUR and DEGT
- D5 connects DEGT and CH.1
- D6 connects DEGT and CH.2
- D7 connects DEGT and BAINS
- D8 connects DEGT and WC

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in DEGT
2. ApproachDoor(D4)
3. OpenDoor(D4)
4. GoThrough(D4) - Now in SEJOUR
5. ApproachDoor(D1)
6. OpenDoor(D1)
7. GoThrough(D1) - Now in CUISINE
8. ApproachDoor(D2)
9. OpenDoor(D2)
10. GoThrough(D2) - Now in CELLIER

The PORCHE is directly accessible from the CELLIER, so no further door actions are needed.

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from DEGT to PORCHE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
