Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the DOUCHE to the CELLIER.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects TERRASSE COUVERTE and CUISINE
2. D2 connects CUISINE and CELLIER
3. D3 connects CUISINE and CH. PARENTS
4. D4 connects DOUCHE and CUISINE

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in DOUCHE
2. Use D4 to enter CUISINE
3. From CUISINE, use D2 to reach CELLIER

Now, I'll provide the detailed action sequence in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from the DOUCHE to the CELLIER, using only the necessary doors (D4 and D2) and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
