Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the CELLIER to the WC.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D2 connects CELLIER and CUISINE
2. D3 connects CUISINE and SEJOUR
3. D4 connects SEJOUR and DEGT
4. D7 connects DEGT and BAINS
5. D8 connects BAINS and WC

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
1. Start in CELLIER
2. Use D2 to enter CUISINE
3. Use D3 to enter SEJOUR
4. Use D4 to enter DEGT
5. Use D7 to enter BAINS
6. Use D8 to enter WC

Now, I'll provide the detailed navigation plan in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan will efficiently guide you from the CELLIER to the WC using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
