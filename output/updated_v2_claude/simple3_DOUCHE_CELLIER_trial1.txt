Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the DOUCHE to the CELLIER.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

Rooms:
1. DOUCHE
2. CH. PARENTS
3. CUISINE (multiple areas labeled as CUISINE)
4. CELLIER
5. TERRASSE COUVERTE

Doors and their connections:
D1: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE and CUISINE
D2: Connects CUISINE and CELLIER
D3: Connects CH. PARENTS and CUISINE
D4: Connects DOUCHE and CUISINE

Now, I'll provide the step-by-step navigation plan from DOUCHE to CELLIER:

1. ApproachDoor(D4)
2. OpenDoor(D4)
3. GoThrough(D4)
4. ApproachDoor(D2)
5. OpenDoor(D2)
6. GoThrough(D2)

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "DOUCHE",
  "end": "CELLIER",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from the DOUCHE to the CELLIER, using only the necessary doors (D4 and D2) and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
