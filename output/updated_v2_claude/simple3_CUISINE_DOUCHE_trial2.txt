Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the CUISINE to the DOUCHE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CUISINE (large central room) - connected to D1, D2, and D3
2. TERRASSE COUVERTE - connected to D1
3. CELLIER - connected to D2
4. CH. PARENTS (two rooms) - connected to D3
5. DOUCHE - connected to D4

Navigation Plan:

To go from CUISINE to DOUCHE, we need to use doors D3 and D4. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. Start in CUISINE
2. ApproachDoor(3)
3. OpenDoor(3)
4. GoThrough(3)
5. ApproachDoor(4)
6. OpenDoor(4)
7. GoThrough(4)

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CUISINE",
  "end": "DOUCHE",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the CUISINE to the DOUCHE using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
