Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the DOUCHE to CHAMBRE 1.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects GARAGES to CELLIER
D2: Connects GARAGES to DOUCHE
D3: Connects CELLIER to CUISINE
D4: Connects WC to HALL
D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
D6: Connects HALL to CUISINE
D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE (second instance)

Now, let's create the navigation plan:

1. Start in DOUCHE
2. ApproachDoor(D2)
3. OpenDoor(D2)
4. GoThrough(D2)
5. ApproachDoor(D4)
6. OpenDoor(D4)
7. GoThrough(D4)
8. ApproachDoor(D5)
9. OpenDoor(D5)
10. GoThrough(D5)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "DOUCHE",
  "end": "CHAMBRE 1",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the DOUCHE to CHAMBRE 1 using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or paths.
