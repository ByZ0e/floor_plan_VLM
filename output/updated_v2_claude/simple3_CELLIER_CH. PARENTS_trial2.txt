Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from the CELLIER to CH. PARENTS.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CELLIER connects to CUISINE through D2
2. CUISINE connects to TERRASSE COUVERTE through D1
3. CUISINE connects to CH. PARENTS through D3
4. CH. PARENTS connects to DOUCHE through D4

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
1. Start in CELLIER
2. ApproachDoor(D2)
3. OpenDoor(D2)
4. GoThrough(D2) to enter CUISINE
5. ApproachDoor(D3)
6. OpenDoor(D3)
7. GoThrough(D3) to enter CH. PARENTS

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CELLIER",
  "end": "CH. PARENTS",
  "actions": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the CELLIER to CH. PARENTS, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
