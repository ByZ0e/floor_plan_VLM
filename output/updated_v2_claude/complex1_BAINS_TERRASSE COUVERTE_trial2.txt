Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll first list out the rooms and their door connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from the BAINS to the TERRASSE COUVERTE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. BAINS: Connected to HALL through D2
2. WC: Connected to HALL through D3
3. CELLIER: Connected to HALL through D1
4. GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER through D9
5. CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL through D5
6. CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL through D4
7. CUISINE: Connected to HALL through D7
8. PORCHE: Connected to HALL through D6
9. TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE through D8

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
1. Start in BAINS
2. ApproachDoor(D2)
3. OpenDoor(D2)
4. GoThrough(D2) to enter HALL
5. ApproachDoor(D7)
6. OpenDoor(D7)
7. GoThrough(D7) to enter CUISINE
8. ApproachDoor(D8)
9. OpenDoor(D8)
10. GoThrough(D8) to reach TERRASSE COUVERTE

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan provides the most efficient route from the BAINS to the TERRASSE COUVERTE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
