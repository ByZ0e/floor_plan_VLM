Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the SEJOUR to the CUISINE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. SEJOUR connects to CH.2 via D3
2. SEJOUR connects to CH.1 via D4
3. SEJOUR connects to CUISINE via D5 and D6
4. CH.3 connects to CH.2 via D2
5. CH.3 connects to SEJOUR via D1

Based on these connections, here's the navigation plan to go from SEJOUR to CUISINE:

1. ApproachDoor(5)
2. OpenDoor(5)
3. GoThrough(5)
4. ApproachDoor(6)
5. OpenDoor(6)
6. GoThrough(6)

Here's the plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from the SEJOUR to the CUISINE, using only the necessary doors (D5 and D6) to reach the destination. The plan avoids any unnecessary rooms or doors, ensuring a straightforward path to the goal.
