Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the WC to the CUISINE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. WC connects to HALL via D4
2. HALL connects to DOUCHE via D2
3. HALL connects to CHAMBRE 1 via D5
4. HALL connects to CUISINE via D6
5. CELLIER connects to GARAGES via D1
6. CELLIER connects to CUISINE via D3
7. CUISINE connects to HALL via D7

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in WC
2. ApproachDoor(D4)
3. OpenDoor(D4)
4. GoThrough(D4) to enter HALL
5. ApproachDoor(D6)
6. OpenDoor(D6)
7. GoThrough(D6) to enter CUISINE

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "WC",
  "end": "CUISINE",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the WC to the CUISINE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
