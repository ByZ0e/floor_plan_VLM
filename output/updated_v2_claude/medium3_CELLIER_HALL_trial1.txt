Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from the CELLIER to the HALL.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects GARAGES and CELLIER
D2: Connects GARAGES and HALL (near DOUCHE)
D3: Connects CELLIER and CUISINE
D4: Connects WC and HALL
D5: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 1
D6: Connects CUISINE and HALL
D7: Connects CUISINE and HALL (lower part)

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CELLIER
2. Use D3 to enter CUISINE
3. Use D6 to enter HALL

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the CELLIER to the HALL, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
