Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from CHAMBRE 1 to GARAGES.

Explicit Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects GARAGES to CELLIER
D2: Connects GARAGES to DOUCHE
D3: Connects CELLIER to CUISINE
D4: Connects WC to HALL
D5: Connects CHAMBRE 1 to HALL
D6: Connects CUISINE to HALL
D7: Connects CUISINE to HALL

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CHAMBRE 1
2. Use D5 to enter HALL
3. Use D6 to enter CUISINE
4. Use D3 to enter CELLIER
5. Use D1 to enter GARAGES

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan will efficiently guide you from CHAMBRE 1 to GARAGES using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
