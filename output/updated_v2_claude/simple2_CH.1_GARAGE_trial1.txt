Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from CH.1 to the GARAGE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects CH.1 to HALL
2. D2 connects CH.1 to HALL
3. D3 connects CH.2 to HALL
4. D4 connects GARAGE to CUISINE
5. D5 connects CUISINE to HALL

Now, let's create a step-by-step navigation plan from CH.1 to GARAGE:

1. Start in CH.1
2. Use D2 to enter the HALL
3. Move through the HALL
4. Use D4 to enter the GARAGE

Here's the detailed action plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "doorNumber": 2
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "doorNumber": 2
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "doorNumber": 2
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "doorNumber": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "doorNumber": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "doorNumber": 4
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from CH.1 to the GARAGE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
