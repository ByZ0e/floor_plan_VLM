Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
2. D2: Connects BAINS to HALL
3. D3: Connects WC to HALL
4. D4: Connects CHAMBRE 1 to HALL
5. D5: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to HALL
6. D6: Connects HALL to PORCHE
7. D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE
8. D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
9. D9: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE

Navigation Plan:
Starting from CHAMBRE 1, we need to reach the TERRASSE COUVERTE. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(D4)
2. OpenDoor(D4)
3. GoThrough(D4)
4. ApproachDoor(D7)
5. OpenDoor(D7)
6. GoThrough(D7)
7. ApproachDoor(D8)
8. OpenDoor(D8)
9. GoThrough(D8)

Now, here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"}
  ]
}
```

This path takes you from CHAMBRE 1 through the HALL, then to the CUISINE, and finally to the TERRASSE COUVERTE. It uses only the necessary doors and avoids any unnecessary rooms or detours.
