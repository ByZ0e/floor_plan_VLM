Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the CUISINE to CH.3.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects CH.3 and SEJOUR
2. D2 connects CH.2 and SEJOUR
3. D3 connects CH.2 and SEJOUR
4. D4 connects CH.1 and SEJOUR
5. D5 connects CUISINE and SEJOUR
6. D6 connects CUISINE and SEJOUR

Now, let's create the navigation plan:

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CUISINE
2. Use D5 or D6 to enter SEJOUR
3. From SEJOUR, use D1 to enter CH.3

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the CUISINE to CH.3, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
