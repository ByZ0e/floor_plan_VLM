Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a detailed navigation plan for you to move from CH.2 to SEJOUR.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects CH.3 and SEJOUR
2. D2 connects CH.2 and CH.3
3. D3 connects CH.2 and SEJOUR
4. D4 connects CH.1 and SEJOUR
5. D5 connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
6. D6 connects SEJOUR and CUISINE

Now, let's create the navigation plan to move from CH.2 to SEJOUR:

Step-by-step solution:
1. You are currently in CH.2.
2. The most direct path to SEJOUR is through D3.
3. Approach D3.
4. Open D3.
5. Go through D3 to enter SEJOUR.

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CH.2",
  "end": "SEJOUR",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from CH.2 to SEJOUR using the available doors. It avoids unnecessary rooms and doors, ensuring a direct path to your destination.
