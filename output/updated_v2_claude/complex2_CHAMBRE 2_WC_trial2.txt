Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from CHAMBRE 2 to WC.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
2. D2: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to HALL
3. D3: Connects HALL to BAINS
4. D4: Connects HALL to WC
5. D5: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to HALL (near PORCHE)
6. D6: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
7. D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE
8. D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
9. D9: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CHAMBRE 2
2. Use D2 to enter the HALL
3. From HALL, use D4 to reach WC

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from CHAMBRE 2 to WC, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
