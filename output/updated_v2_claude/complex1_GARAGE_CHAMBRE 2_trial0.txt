Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the GARAGE to CHAMBRE 2.

Room and Door Connections:
- D9: Connects CELLIER and GARAGE
- D1: Connects CELLIER and HALL
- D2: Connects BAINS and HALL
- D3: Connects WC and HALL
- D4: Connects CHAMBRE 1 and HALL
- D5: Connects CHAMBRE 2 and HALL
- D6: Connects PORCHE and HALL
- D7: Connects CUISINE and HALL
- D8: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE

Navigation Plan:
To go from the GARAGE to CHAMBRE 2, we need to use the following doors: D9, D1, and D5.

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in GARAGE
2. ApproachDoor(9)
3. OpenDoor(9)
4. GoThrough(9) - Now in CELLIER
5. ApproachDoor(1)
6. OpenDoor(1)
7. GoThrough(1) - Now in HALL
8. ApproachDoor(5)
9. OpenDoor(5)
10. GoThrough(5) - Now in CHAMBRE 2

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 9},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5}
  ]
}
```

This path efficiently navigates from the GARAGE to CHAMBRE 2 using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
