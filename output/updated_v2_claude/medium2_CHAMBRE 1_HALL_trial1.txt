Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. Let's start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections based on the image:

Room and Door Connections:
1. CHAMBRE 1 <-> D2 <-> HALL
2. HALL <-> D3 <-> WC
3. HALL <-> D4 <-> BAINS
4. HALL <-> D5 <-> CHAMBRE 3
5. HALL <-> D6 <-> CHAMBRE 2
6. HALL <-> D7 <-> CELLIER
7. HALL <-> D8 <-> Porche
8. GARAGE <-> D1 <-> CELLIER

Now, let's create the navigation plan to go from CHAMBRE 1 to HALL:

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CHAMBRE 1
2. Approach door D2
3. Open door D2
4. Go through door D2 to enter HALL

Since we only need to go through one door to reach the HALL from CHAMBRE 1, the plan is straightforward. Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates you from CHAMBRE 1 to HALL using the necessary door D2. No unnecessary doors or rooms are included in the path.
