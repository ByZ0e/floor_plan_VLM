Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the CUISINE to CH.3.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects SEJOUR to CH.3
2. D2: Connects CH.2 to CH.3
3. D3: Connects CH.2 to SEJOUR
4. D4: Connects CH.1 to SEJOUR
5. D5: Connects CUISINE to SEJOUR
6. D6: Connects CUISINE to SEJOUR

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CUISINE
2. Use D5 to enter SEJOUR
3. Cross SEJOUR
4. Use D1 to enter CH.3

Now, I'll provide the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the CUISINE to CH.3, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
