Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from CH.1 to CH.2.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects CH.3 and SEJOUR
2. D2 connects CH.2 and SEJOUR
3. D3 connects CH.2 and SEJOUR
4. D4 connects CH.1 and SEJOUR
5. D5 connects CUISINE and SEJOUR
6. D6 connects CUISINE and SEJOUR

Now, let's create a step-by-step navigation plan from CH.1 to CH.2:

1. Start in CH.1
2. Use D4 to enter SEJOUR
3. From SEJOUR, use D3 to enter CH.2

Here's the detailed action plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from CH.1 to CH.2 using only the necessary doors. It avoids any unnecessary rooms or doors and ensures that each action is correct for traversal to the end goal.
