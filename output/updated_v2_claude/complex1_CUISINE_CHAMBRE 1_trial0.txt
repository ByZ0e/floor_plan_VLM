Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from the CUISINE to CHAMBRE 1.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects CELLIER and HALL
D2: Connects BAINS and HALL
D3: Connects WC and HALL
D4: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 1
D5: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 2
D6: Connects HALL and PORCHE
D7: Connects HALL and CUISINE
D8: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Connects CELLIER and GARAGE

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in CUISINE
2. ApproachDoor(D7)
3. OpenDoor(D7)
4. GoThrough(D7)
5. ApproachDoor(D4)
6. OpenDoor(D4)
7. GoThrough(D4)

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CUISINE",
  "end": "CHAMBRE 1",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the CUISINE to CHAMBRE 1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
