Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from SEJOUR to CH.1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
2. D2 connects CUISINE to CELLIER
3. D3 connects CUISINE to SEJOUR
4. D4 connects SEJOUR to DEGT
5. D5 connects DEGT to CH.1
6. D6 connects DEGT to CH.2
7. D7 connects DEGT to BAINS
8. D8 connects CUISINE to WC

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in SEJOUR
2. Approach D4
3. Open D4
4. Go through D4 to enter DEGT
5. Approach D5
6. Open D5
7. Go through D5 to enter CH.1

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from SEJOUR to CH.1 using only the necessary doors. The robot will start in SEJOUR, use D4 to enter DEGT, and then use D5 to reach CH.1.
