Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from CH.3 to CH.1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects CH.3 and SEJOUR (left side)
2. D2 connects CH.2 and SEJOUR (left side)
3. D3 connects CH.2 and SEJOUR (middle)
4. D4 connects CH.1 and SEJOUR (right side)
5. D5 connects SEJOUR (right side) and CUISINE
6. D6 connects SEJOUR (bottom) and CUISINE

Navigation Plan:
To get from CH.3 to CH.1, we need to go through the SEJOUR. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(1)
2. OpenDoor(1)
3. GoThrough(1)
4. ApproachDoor(4)
5. OpenDoor(4)
6. GoThrough(4)

Now, let's present this plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CH.3",
  "end": "CH.1",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from CH.3 to CH.1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
