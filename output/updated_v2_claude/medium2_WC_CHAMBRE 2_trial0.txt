Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the WC to CHAMBRE 2.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects GARAGE to HALL
2. D2 connects CHAMBRE 1 to HALL
3. D3 connects WC to HALL
4. D4 connects BAINS to HALL
5. D5 connects CHAMBRE 3 to HALL
6. D6 connects CHAMBRE 2 to HALL
7. D7 connects CELLIER to HALL
8. D8 connects HALL to Porche

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in WC
2. Use D3 to enter HALL
3. From HALL, use D6 to enter CHAMBRE 2

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the WC to CHAMBRE 2, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
