Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the PORCHE to the LINGERIE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER
2. D2: Connects PORCHE to CELLIER
3. D3: Connects PORCHE to HALL
4. D4: Connects HALL to WC
5. D5: Connects HALL to LINGERIE
6. D6: Connects HALL to BUREAU
7. D7: Connects HALL to BAINS
8. D8: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE PARENTS
9. D9: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
10. D10: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
11. D11: Connects CELLIER to HALL

Navigation Plan:
To go from the PORCHE to the LINGERIE, we need to use two doors: D3 and D5.

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in PORCHE
2. Use D3 to enter HALL
3. Use D5 to enter LINGERIE

Final Navigation Plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "PORCHE",
  "end": "LINGERIE",
  "steps": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from the PORCHE to the LINGERIE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
