Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects Cellier to Hall
2. D2: Connects Chambre 2 to Hall
3. D3: Connects Bains to Hall
4. D4: Connects WC to Hall
5. D5: Connects Porche to Hall
6. D6: Connects Chambre 1 to Hall
7. D7: Connects Cuisine to Hall
8. D8: Connects Cuisine to Terrasse Couverte
9. D9: Connects Garage to Cellier

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in Chambre 1
2. Approach and open D6 to enter the Hall
3. Move through the Hall to D7
4. Open D7 to enter the Cuisine
5. Move through the Cuisine to D8
6. Open D8 to reach the Terrasse Couverte

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CHAMBRE 1",
  "end": "TERRASSE COUVERTE",
  "actions": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from Chambre 1 to Terrasse Couverte, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
