Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms, doors, and connections, then provide a navigation plan from CH.2 to SEJOUR.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

1. CH.3 connects to SEJOUR through D1
2. CH.2 connects to CH.2 through D2
3. CH.2 connects to SEJOUR through D3
4. CH.1 connects to SEJOUR through D4
5. CUISINE connects to SEJOUR through D5
6. SEJOUR connects to SEJOUR through D6

Now, let's create the navigation plan from CH.2 to SEJOUR:

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CH.2
2. Use D3 to go directly from CH.2 to SEJOUR

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CH.2",
  "end": "SEJOUR",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from CH.2 to SEJOUR using only the necessary door (D3) that connects these two rooms directly.
