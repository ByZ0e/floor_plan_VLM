Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1 connects CELLIER and SEJOUR
- D2 connects CELLIER and CUISINE
- D3 connects CUISINE and SEJOUR
- D4 connects SEJOUR and DEGT
- D5 connects DEGT and CH.1
- D6 connects DEGT and CH.2
- D7 connects DEGT and BAINS
- D8 connects DEGT and WC

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in CELLIER
2. Use D1 to enter SEJOUR
3. Cross SEJOUR to D4
4. Use D4 to enter DEGT
5. From DEGT, use D8 to reach WC

Now, I'll provide the detailed action sequence in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan provides the most efficient route from the CELLIER to the WC, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
