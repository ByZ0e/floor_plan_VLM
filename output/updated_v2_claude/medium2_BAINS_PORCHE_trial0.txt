Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from BAINS to PORCHE.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects GARAGE and HALL
- D2: Connects CHAMBRE1 and HALL
- D3: Connects HALL and WC
- D4: Connects BAINS and HALL
- D5: Connects CHAMBRE3 and HALL
- D6: Connects CHAMBRE2 and HALL
- D7: Connects CELLIER and HALL
- D8: Connects HALL and PORCHE

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in BAINS
2. ApproachDoor(D4)
3. OpenDoor(D4)
4. GoThrough(D4) to enter HALL
5. ApproachDoor(D8)
6. OpenDoor(D8)
7. GoThrough(D8) to reach PORCHE

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from BAINS to PORCHE using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
