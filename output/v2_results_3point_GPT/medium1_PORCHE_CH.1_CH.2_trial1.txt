### Navigation Plan

Starting in the Porche, the goal is to navigate to CH.1 and then to CH.2. The sequence of actions is as follows:

```json
[
  {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
  {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
  {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
  {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
  {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
  {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
  {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
  {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
  {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
  {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
  {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
  {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
  {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
  {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
  {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"}
]
```

   - Go through Door D4 to enter DEGT.

3. **DEGT to CH.1**:
   - Approach Door D5.
   - Open Door D5.
   - Go through Door D5 to enter CH.1.

4. **CH.1 to DEGT**:
   - Approach Door D5.
   - Open Door D5.
   - Go through Door D5 to enter DEGT.

5. **DEGT to CH.2**:
   - Approach Door D6.
