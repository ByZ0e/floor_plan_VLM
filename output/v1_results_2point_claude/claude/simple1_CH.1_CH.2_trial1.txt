Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide the navigation plan to get from CH.1 to CH.2.

Rooms and Doors:
1. CH.1 - connected to SEJOUR via D4
2. CH.2 - connected to SEJOUR via D3
3. CH.3 - connected to SEJOUR via D1 and D2
4. SEJOUR - central area connected to all other rooms
5. CUISINE - connected to SEJOUR via D5 and D6

Navigation Plan:
To go from CH.1 to CH.2, we need to go through the SEJOUR area. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. Start in CH.1
2. Use D4 to enter SEJOUR
3. Cross SEJOUR
4. Use D3 to enter CH.2

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CH.1",
  "end": "CH.2",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from CH.1 to CH.2, using only the necessary doors (D4 and D3) and avoiding any unnecessary detours through other rooms or doors.
