Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and their door connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the GARAGE to the BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
1. GARAGE: connected to CHAMBRE 1 via D1
2. CHAMBRE 1: connected to GARAGE via D1, connected to HALL via D2
3. HALL: connected to CHAMBRE 1 via D2, connected to BAINS via D4, connected to CHAMBRE 2 via D6, connected to CELLIER via D7, connected to Porche via D8
4. BAINS: connected to HALL via D4
5. CHAMBRE 3: connected to HALL via D5
6. CHAMBRE 2: connected to HALL via D6
7. CELLIER: connected to HALL via D7
8. Porche: connected to HALL via D8

Navigation Plan:
To get from the GARAGE to the BAINS, we need to go through CHAMBRE 1 and the HALL. Here's the step-by-step plan:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the GARAGE to the BAINS using only the necessary doors and rooms.
