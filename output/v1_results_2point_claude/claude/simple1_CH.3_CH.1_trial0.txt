Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan to get from CH.3 to CH.1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CH.3 connects to SEJOUR through D1
2. CH.2 connects to SEJOUR through D2 and D3
3. CH.1 connects to SEJOUR through D4
4. CUISINE connects to SEJOUR through D5 and D6

Now, for the navigation plan from CH.3 to CH.1:

1. We start in CH.3
2. We need to go through SEJOUR to reach CH.1
3. The path will be: CH.3 -> D1 -> SEJOUR -> D4 -> CH.1

Here's the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CH.3 to CH.1 using only the necessary doors (D1 and D4) and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
