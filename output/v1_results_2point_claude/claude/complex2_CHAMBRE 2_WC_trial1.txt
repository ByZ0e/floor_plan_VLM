Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan from CHAMBRE 2 to WC.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CHAMBRE 2 - D2 - HALL
2. HALL - D3 - BAINS
3. HALL - D4 - WC
4. CHAMBRE 1 - D6 - HALL
5. CUISINE - D7 - HALL
6. CUISINE - D8 - TERRASSE COUVERTE
7. GARAGE - D9 - CELLIER
8. CELLIER - D1 - HALL
9. PORCHE - D5 - HALL

Navigation Plan:
To go from CHAMBRE 2 to WC, we need to use two doors: D2 and D4.

Here's the step-by-step navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from CHAMBRE 2 to WC using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
