Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from DEGT to PORCHE.

Room and Door Connections:
- DEGT is connected to SEJOUR via D4
- DEGT is connected to CH.2 via D6
- DEGT is connected to WC via D8
- SEJOUR is connected to CUISINE via D3
- SEJOUR is connected to CH.1 via D5
- CUISINE is connected to CELLIER via D2
- SEJOUR is connected to PORCHE via D1

Now, for the navigation plan from DEGT to PORCHE:

1. ApproachDoor(4)
2. OpenDoor(4)
3. GoThrough(4)
4. ApproachDoor(1)
5. OpenDoor(1)
6. GoThrough(1)

Here's the plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "DEGT",
  "end": "PORCHE",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan takes you from DEGT to SEJOUR through D4, and then from SEJOUR to PORCHE through D1, which is the most direct and efficient route based on the floor plan provided.
