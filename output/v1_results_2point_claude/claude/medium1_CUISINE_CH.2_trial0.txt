First, let's list out the rooms and doors with their connections based on the floor plan:

Rooms:
1. CUISINE
2. SEJOUR
3. CELLIER
4. CH.1
5. CH.2
6. DEGT (Dégagement, likely a hallway)
7. WC
8. BAINS

Doors and their connections:
D1: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
D2: Connects CUISINE and CELLIER
D3: Connects CUISINE and SEJOUR
D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
D5: Connects DEGT and CH.1
D6: Connects DEGT and CH.2
D7: Connects DEGT and BAINS
D8: Connects DEGT and WC

Now, for the navigation task from CUISINE to CH.2, here's the detailed plan:

{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"}
  ]
}

This plan takes you from the CUISINE through the SEJOUR and DEGT (hallway) to reach CH.2, using only the necessary doors along the path.
