Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the room and door connections, then provide you with a navigation plan to get from CHAMBRE 1 to the HALL.

Room and Door Connections:
- CHAMBRE 1 connects to HALL via D2
- HALL connects to CELLIER via D7
- CELLIER connects to GARAGE via D1
- HALL connects to CHAMBRE 2 via D6
- HALL connects to CHAMBRE 3 and BAINS via D5
- BAINS connects to WC via D3
- HALL connects to Porche via D8
- GARAGE connects to outside via D1

For your navigation task from CHAMBRE 1 to HALL, here's the efficient path:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently guide you from CHAMBRE 1 to the HALL using the most direct route. You'll only need to use one door (D2) to accomplish this task. Once you go through D2, you'll be in the HALL, which is your destination.
