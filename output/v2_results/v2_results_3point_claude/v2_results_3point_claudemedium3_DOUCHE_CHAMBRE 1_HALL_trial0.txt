Certainly! I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections based on the floor plan image, then provide a detailed navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects GARAGES to CELLIER
2. D2: Connects GARAGES to DOUCHE
3. D3: Connects CELLIER to CUISINE
4. D4: Connects WC to HALL
5. D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
6. D6: Connects HALL to CUISINE
7. D7: Connects CUISINE to HALL

Now, let's create the navigation plan to go from DOUCHE to CHAMBRE 1, and then to HALL.

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in DOUCHE
2. Use D2 to enter GARAGES
3. Use D1 to enter CELLIER
4. Use D3 to enter CUISINE
5. Use D6 to enter HALL
6. Use D5 to enter CHAMBRE 1
7. Use D5 again to return to HALL (final destination)

Here's the JSON format of the final navigation plan:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from DOUCHE to CHAMBRE 1 and then to HALL, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
