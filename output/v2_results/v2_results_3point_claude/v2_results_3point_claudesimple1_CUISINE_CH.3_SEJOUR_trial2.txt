Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects SEJOUR and CH.3
2. D2 connects CH.2 and CH.3
3. D3 connects CH.2 and SEJOUR
4. D4 connects CH.1 and SEJOUR
5. D5 connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
6. D6 connects SEJOUR and CUISINE

Now, let's create the navigation plan based on these connections:

Step 1: CUISINE to CH.3
- ApproachDoor(5)
- OpenDoor(5)
- GoThrough(5)
- ApproachDoor(1)
- OpenDoor(1)
- GoThrough(1)

Step 2: CH.3 to SEJOUR
- ApproachDoor(1)
- OpenDoor(1)
- GoThrough(1)

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates you from the CUISINE to CH.3, and then to SEJOUR, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
