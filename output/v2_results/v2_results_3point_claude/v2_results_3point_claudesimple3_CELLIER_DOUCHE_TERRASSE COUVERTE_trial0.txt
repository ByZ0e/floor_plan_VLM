Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE and CUISINE
D2: Connects CUISINE and CELLIER
D3: Connects CUISINE and CH. PARENTS
D4: Connects CH. PARENTS and DOUCHE

Now, let's create the navigation plan based on these connections:

Step 1: Begin in CELLIER
Step 2: Move to CUISINE
Step 3: Move to CH. PARENTS
Step 4: Move to DOUCHE
Step 5: Return to CH. PARENTS
Step 6: Return to CUISINE
Step 7: Move to TERRASSE COUVERTE

Here's the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CELLIER to DOUCHE and then to TERRASSE COUVERTE, using only the necessary doors and following the layout of the floor plan.
