Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the connections and provide a navigation plan as requested.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects Garage to Cellier
D2: Connects Cellier to Porche
D3: Connects Porche to Hall
D4: Connects Hall to WC
D5: Connects Hall to Lingerie
D6: Connects Hall to Bureau
D7: Connects Hall to Bains
D8: Connects Hall to Chambre Parents
D9: Connects Hall to Chambre Enfant 2
D10: Connects Hall to Chambre Enfant 1
D11: Connects Cellier to Hall

Step-by-step navigation plan:

1. Start in Bains
2. Go from Bains to Hall through D7
3. Go from Hall to Chambre Enfant 1 through D10
4. Go from Chambre Enfant 1 to Hall through D10
5. Go from Hall to Chambre Enfant 2 through D9

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 10},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 10},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 9}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from Bains to Chambre Enfant 1 and then to Chambre Enfant 2, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
