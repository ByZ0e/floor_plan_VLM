Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan as requested.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects GARAGE and HALL
D2: Connects CHAMBRE1 and HALL
D3: Connects HALL and WC
D4: Connects HALL and BAINS
D5: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 3
D6: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 2
D7: Connects HALL and CELLIER
D8: Connects HALL and Porche

Step-by-step navigation plan:

1. Start in CHAMBRE 1
2. Use D2 to enter HALL
3. Use D4 to enter BAINS
4. Return to HALL through D4
5. Use D1 to enter GARAGE

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CHAMBRE 1 to BAINS and then to GARAGE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
