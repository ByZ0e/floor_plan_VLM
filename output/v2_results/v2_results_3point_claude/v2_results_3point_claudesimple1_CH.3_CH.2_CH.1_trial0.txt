Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan for your task.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1 connects CH.3 and SEJOUR (left)
- D2 connects CH.3 and CH.2
- D3 connects CH.2 and SEJOUR (center)
- D4 connects SEJOUR (center) and CH.1
- D5 connects SEJOUR (right) and CUISINE
- D6 connects SEJOUR (bottom) and CUISINE

Navigation Plan:
Starting in CH.3, to reach CH.2, and finally CH.1:

1. From CH.3 to CH.2:
   - ApproachDoor(D2)
   - OpenDoor(D2)
   - GoThrough(D2)

2. From CH.2 to CH.1:
   - ApproachDoor(D3)
   - OpenDoor(D3)
   - GoThrough(D3)
   - ApproachDoor(D4)
   - OpenDoor(D4)
   - GoThrough(D4)

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates you from CH.3 to CH.2 and finally to CH.1 using only the necessary doors along the path.
