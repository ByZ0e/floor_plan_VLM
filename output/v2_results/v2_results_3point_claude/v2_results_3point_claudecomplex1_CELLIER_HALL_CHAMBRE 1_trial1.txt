Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan for your robot to move from the CELLIER to CHAMBRE 1 via the HALL.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
2. D2: Connects HALL to BAINS
3. D3: Connects HALL to WC
4. D4: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
5. D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 2
6. D6: Connects HALL to PORCHE
7. D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE
8. D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
9. D9: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE

Navigation Plan:
To go from CELLIER to CHAMBRE 1 via HALL, we need to use doors D1 and D4. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. Start in CELLIER
2. ApproachDoor(D1)
3. OpenDoor(D1)
4. GoThrough(D1) // Now in HALL
5. ApproachDoor(D4)
6. OpenDoor(D4)
7. GoThrough(D4) // Now in CHAMBRE 1

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates the robot from CELLIER to CHAMBRE 1 via HALL, using only the necessary doors (D1 and D4) and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
