Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan based on those connections.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
2. D2: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to HALL
3. D3: Connects BAINS to HALL
4. D4: Connects WC to HALL
5. D5: Connects PORCHE to HALL
6. D6: Connects CHAMBRE 1 to HALL
7. D7: Connects CUISINE to HALL
8. D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
9. D9: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
1. Start in CHAMBRE 1
2. Exit CHAMBRE 1 to HALL through D6
3. Move through HALL to CUISINE
4. Exit CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE through D8
5. Return to CUISINE through D8
6. Exit CUISINE to HALL through D7
7. Arrive at HALL (final destination)

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan in the requested JSON format using only the necessary actions:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CHAMBRE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE and then to HALL, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
