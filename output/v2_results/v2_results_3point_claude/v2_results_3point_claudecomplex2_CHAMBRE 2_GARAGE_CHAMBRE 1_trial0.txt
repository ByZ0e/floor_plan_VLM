Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects Cellier and Hall
- D2: Connects Chambre 2 and Hall
- D3: Connects Hall and Bains
- D4: Connects Hall and WC
- D5: Connects Chambre 2 and Porche
- D6: Connects Hall and Chambre 1
- D7: Connects Cuisine and Hall
- D8: Connects Cuisine and Terrasse Couverte
- D9: Connects Garage and Cellier

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in Chambre 2
2. Use D2 to enter the Hall
3. Use D1 to enter the Cellier
4. Use D9 to enter the Garage
5. Use D9 to return to the Cellier
6. Use D1 to enter the Hall
7. Use D6 to enter Chambre 1

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from Chambre 2 to Garage and then to Chambre 1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
