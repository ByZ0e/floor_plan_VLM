Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list the relevant rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from the GARAGE to the WC via the CELLIER.

Relevant Room and Door Connections:
- D1 connects GARAGE to CELLIER
- D3 connects CELLIER to HALL
- D4 connects HALL to WC

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
1. Start in GARAGE
2. Use D1 to go from GARAGE to CELLIER
3. Use D3 to go from CELLIER to HALL
4. Use D4 to go from HALL to WC

Now, I'll provide the detailed navigation plan in the requested format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the GARAGE to the WC via the CELLIER, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
