Thank you for providing the floor plan image. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan based on your requirements.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CELLIER - connected to CUISINE via D2
2. CUISINE - connected to CELLIER via D2, to TERRASSE COUVERTE via D1, and to CH. PARENTS via D3
3. TERRASSE COUVERTE - connected to CUISINE via D1
4. CH. PARENTS - connected to CUISINE via D3, and to DOUCHE via D4
5. DOUCHE - connected to CH. PARENTS via D4

Now, let's create the navigation plan from CELLIER to DOUCHE to TERRASSE COUVERTE:

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CELLIER
2. Go from CELLIER to CUISINE through D2
3. Go from CUISINE to CH. PARENTS through D3
4. Go from CH. PARENTS to DOUCHE through D4
5. Go from DOUCHE back to CH. PARENTS through D4
6. Go from CH. PARENTS to CUISINE through D3
7. Go from CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE through D1

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the CELLIER to DOUCHE and then to TERRASSE COUVERTE, using only the necessary doors and following the rules of opening and going through each door.
