Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Rooms and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE to CUISINE
- D2: Connects CUISINE to CELLIER
- D3: Connects CUISINE to CH. PARENTS
- D4: Connects CH. PARENTS to DOUCHE

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
1. Start in CH. PARENTS
2. Use D3 to enter CUISINE
3. Use D4 to enter DOUCHE

Here's the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 4
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CH. PARENTS to CUISINE, and then to DOUCHE, using only the necessary doors (D3 and D4) to reach the destination.
