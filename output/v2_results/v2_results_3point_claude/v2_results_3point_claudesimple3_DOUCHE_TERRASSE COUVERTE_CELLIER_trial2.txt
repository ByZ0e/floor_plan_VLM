Thank you for providing the floor plan. Let's start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections based on the image:

Rooms and Door Connections:
1. DOUCHE - connected to CH. PARENTS via D4
2. CH. PARENTS - connected to DOUCHE via D4, and to CUISINE via D3
3. CUISINE (large central area) - connected to CH. PARENTS via D3, to CELLIER via D2, and to TERRASSE COUVERTE via D1
4. CELLIER - connected to CUISINE via D2
5. TERRASSE COUVERTE - connected to CUISINE via D1

Now, let's create a step-by-step navigation plan based on these connections:

1. Start in DOUCHE
2. Go from DOUCHE to CH. PARENTS through D4
3. Go from CH. PARENTS to CUISINE through D3
4. Go from CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE through D1
5. Go from TERRASSE COUVERTE back to CUISINE through D1
6. Go from CUISINE to CELLIER through D2

Here's the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from DOUCHE to TERRASSE COUVERTE and then to CELLIER, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
