Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. Let me first list out the rooms and doors with their connections based on the image:

Room and Door Connections:
- CH.1 is connected to SEJOUR through D4
- CH.2 is connected to SEJOUR through D3
- CH.2 is connected to CH.3 through D2
- CH.3 is connected to SEJOUR through D1
- CUISINE is connected to SEJOUR through D6
- CUISINE is connected to SEJOUR through D5

Now, let's create a step-by-step navigation plan to go from CH.1 to CH.2, and then to SEJOUR:

1. Start in CH.1
2. To get to CH.2:
   - ApproachDoor(D4)
   - OpenDoor(D4)
   - GoThrough(D4) to enter SEJOUR
   - ApproachDoor(D3)
   - OpenDoor(D3)
   - GoThrough(D3) to enter CH.2
3. To get from CH.2 to SEJOUR:
   - ApproachDoor(D3)
   - OpenDoor(D3)
   - GoThrough(D3) to enter SEJOUR

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates you from CH.1 to CH.2 and then to SEJOUR, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
