Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects GARAGE and HALL
- D2: Connects CHAMBRE1 and HALL
- D3: Connects HALL and WC
- D4: Connects HALL and BAINS
- D5: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE3
- D6: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE2
- D7: Connects HALL and CELLIER
- D8: Connects HALL and Porche

Navigation Plan:
To go from HALL to CELLIER to GARAGE, we need to use doors D7 and D1. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. Start in HALL
2. ApproachDoor(7)
3. OpenDoor(7)
4. GoThrough(7)
5. ApproachDoor(7)
6. OpenDoor(7)
7. GoThrough(7)
8. ApproachDoor(1)
9. OpenDoor(1)
10. GoThrough(1)

Here's the plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "HALL",
  "destination": "GARAGE",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the HALL to the CELLIER and then to the GARAGE using only the necessary doors (D7 and D1) without any unnecessary detours.
