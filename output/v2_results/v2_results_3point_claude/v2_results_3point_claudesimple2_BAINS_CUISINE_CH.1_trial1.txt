Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1 connects BAINS to HALL
- D2 connects CH.1 to HALL
- D3 connects CH.2 to HALL
- D4 connects GARAGE to CUISINE
- D5 connects CUISINE to HALL

Navigation Plan:
To go from BAINS to CUISINE and then to CH.1, we'll use the following sequence:

1. Start in BAINS
2. Use D1 to enter HALL
3. Use D5 to enter CUISINE
4. Use D5 to return to HALL
5. Use D2 to enter CH.1

Here's the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from BAINS to CUISINE and then to CH.1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
