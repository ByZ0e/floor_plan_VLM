Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan for your robot to move from BAINS to CUISINE and finally to GARAGE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects BAINS to HALL
2. D2: Connects CH.1 to HALL
3. D3: Connects CH.2 to HALL
4. D4: Connects GARAGE to CUISINE
5. D5: Connects CUISINE to HALL

Step-by-step navigation plan:

1. Start in BAINS
2. Use D1 to enter HALL
3. Move through HALL
4. Use D5 to enter CUISINE
5. Move through CUISINE
6. Use D4 to enter GARAGE

Now, I'll provide the detailed action sequence in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently guides the robot from BAINS to CUISINE and finally to GARAGE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
