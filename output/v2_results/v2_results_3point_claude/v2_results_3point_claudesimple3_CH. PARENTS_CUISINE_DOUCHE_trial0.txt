Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. Let's start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections based on the image:

Rooms and Door Connections:
1. CH. PARENTS connects to CUISINE via D3
2. CUISINE connects to CELLIER via D2
3. CUISINE connects to TERRASSE COUVERTE via D1
4. CUISINE connects to DOUCHE via D4

Now, let's create the step-by-step navigation plan based on these connections:

1. Start in CH. PARENTS
2. Use D3 to enter CUISINE
3. From CUISINE, use D4 to reach DOUCHE

Here's the detailed action plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D3"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D3"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D3"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D4"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from CH. PARENTS to DOUCHE, using only the necessary doors (D3 and D4) and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors. The plan takes into account that doors close after each GoThrough action, so each door needs to be approached and opened before going through.
