Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the room and door connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE and CUISINE
D2: Connects CUISINE and CELLIER
D3: Connects CUISINE and CH. PARENTS
D4: Connects CH. PARENTS and DOUCHE

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
1. Start in DOUCHE
2. Go through D4 to enter CH. PARENTS
3. Go through D3 to enter CUISINE
4. Go through D1 to enter TERRASSE COUVERTE
5. Return through D1 to enter CUISINE
6. Go through D2 to reach CELLIER

Now, I'll provide the detailed action plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from DOUCHE to TERRASSE COUVERTE and finally to CELLIER, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
