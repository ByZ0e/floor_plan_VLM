Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms, doors, and their connections, then provide a navigation plan as requested.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

Rooms:
1. TERRASSE COUVERTE
2. CUISINE (multiple areas)
3. CELLIER
4. CH. PARENTS (two rooms)
5. DOUCHE

Doors and their connections:
D1: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE to CUISINE
D2: Connects CUISINE to CELLIER
D3: Connects CUISINE to CH. PARENTS
D4: Connects CH. PARENTS to DOUCHE

Now, I'll provide a step-by-step navigation plan based on these connections:

Step 1: From TERRASSE COUVERTE to CH. PARENTS
1. ApproachDoor(1)
2. OpenDoor(1)
3. GoThrough(1)
4. ApproachDoor(3)
5. OpenDoor(3)
6. GoThrough(3)

Step 2: From CH. PARENTS to CUISINE
7. ApproachDoor(3)
8. OpenDoor(3)
9. GoThrough(3)

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to CH. PARENTS and then to CUISINE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
