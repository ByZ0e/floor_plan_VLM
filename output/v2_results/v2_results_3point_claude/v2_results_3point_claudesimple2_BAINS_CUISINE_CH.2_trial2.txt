Thank you for providing the floor plan. Let me first list out the rooms and doors with their connections based on the image:

Room and Door Connections:
1. BAINS connects to HALL via D1
2. CH.1 connects to HALL via D2
3. CH.2 connects to HALL via D3
4. GARAGE connects to CUISINE via D4
5. CUISINE connects to HALL via D5

Now, let's create a step-by-step navigation plan to go from BAINS to CUISINE, and then to CH.2:

Step 1: Exit BAINS
1. ApproachDoor(1)
2. OpenDoor(1)
3. GoThrough(1)

Step 2: Navigate through HALL to CUISINE
4. ApproachDoor(5)
5. OpenDoor(5)
6. GoThrough(5)

Step 3: Exit CUISINE and return to HALL
7. ApproachDoor(5)
8. OpenDoor(5)
9. GoThrough(5)

Step 4: Enter CH.2
10. ApproachDoor(3)
11. OpenDoor(3)
12. GoThrough(3)

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "doorNumber": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "doorNumber": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "doorNumber": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "doorNumber": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "doorNumber": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "doorNumber": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "doorNumber": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "doorNumber": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "doorNumber": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "doorNumber": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "doorNumber": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "doorNumber": 3}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from BAINS to CUISINE and then to CH.2, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
