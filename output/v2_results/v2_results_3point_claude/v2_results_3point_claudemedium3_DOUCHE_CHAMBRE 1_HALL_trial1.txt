Thank you for providing the floor plan image. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects GARAGES to CELLIER
D2: Connects GARAGES to DOUCHE
D3: Connects CELLIER to CUISINE
D4: Connects WC to HALL
D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
D6: Connects HALL to CUISINE
D7: Connects CUISINE to HALL

Now, let's create the navigation plan to go from DOUCHE to CHAMBRE 1, then to HALL:

Step 1: DOUCHE to CHAMBRE 1
1. ApproachDoor(D2)
2. OpenDoor(D2)
3. GoThrough(D2)
4. ApproachDoor(D5)
5. OpenDoor(D5)
6. GoThrough(D5)

Step 2: CHAMBRE 1 to HALL
We're already in the HALL after Step 1, so no additional actions are needed.

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from DOUCHE to CHAMBRE 1 and then to HALL, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
