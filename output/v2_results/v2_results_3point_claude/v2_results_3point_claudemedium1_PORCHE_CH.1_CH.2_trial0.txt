Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms, doors, and their connections, then provide a navigation plan as requested.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

Rooms:
- PORCHE
- SEJOUR (large room with multiple labels)
- CUISINE
- CELLIER
- CH.1
- CH.2 (large room with multiple labels)
- DEGT (degagement, likely a hallway or corridor)
- WC
- BAINS

Doors and their connections:
D1: Connects PORCHE and SEJOUR
D2: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
D3: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
D5: Connects CH.1 and DEGT
D6: Connects CH.2 and DEGT
D7: Connects DEGT and BAINS
D8: Connects DEGT and WC

Navigation Plan:
To go from PORCHE to CH.1, then to CH.2, we need to use the following sequence of actions:

1. ApproachDoor(D1)
2. OpenDoor(D1)
3. GoThrough(D1)
4. ApproachDoor(D4)
5. OpenDoor(D4)
6. GoThrough(D4)
7. ApproachDoor(D5)
8. OpenDoor(D5)
9. GoThrough(D5)
10. ApproachDoor(D5)
11. OpenDoor(D5)
12. GoThrough(D5)
13. ApproachDoor(D6)
14. OpenDoor(D6)
15. GoThrough(D6)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the PORCHE to CH.1 and then to CH.2, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
