Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects GARAGES and CELLIER
D2: Connects GARAGES and DOUCHE
D3: Connects CELLIER and CUISINE
D4: Connects WC and HALL
D5: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 1
D6: Connects HALL and CUISINE
D7: Connects CUISINE and HALL

Now, let's create the navigation plan from CHAMBRE 1 to CELLIER, and finally to GARAGES:

Step 1: From CHAMBRE 1 to CELLIER
1. ApproachDoor(D5)
2. OpenDoor(D5)
3. GoThrough(D5)
4. ApproachDoor(D6)
5. OpenDoor(D6)
6. GoThrough(D6)
7. ApproachDoor(D3)
8. OpenDoor(D3)
9. GoThrough(D3)

Step 2: From CELLIER to GARAGES
10. ApproachDoor(D1)
11. OpenDoor(D1)
12. GoThrough(D1)

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CHAMBRE 1 to CELLIER and finally to GARAGES, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
