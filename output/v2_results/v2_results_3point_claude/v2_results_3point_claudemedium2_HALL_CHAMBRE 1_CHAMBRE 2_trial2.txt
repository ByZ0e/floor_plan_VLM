Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects GARAGE and HALL
- D2: Connects CHAMBRE 1 and HALL
- D3: Connects HALL and WC
- D4: Connects HALL and BAINS
- D5: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 3
- D6: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 2
- D7: Connects HALL and CELLIER
- D8: Connects HALL and Porche

Navigation Plan:
Starting from HALL, the robot needs to go to CHAMBRE 1, and then to CHAMBRE 2.

Step-by-step solution:
1. From HALL to CHAMBRE 1:
   - ApproachDoor(D2)
   - OpenDoor(D2)
   - GoThrough(D2)

2. From CHAMBRE 1 to CHAMBRE 2:
   - ApproachDoor(D2)
   - OpenDoor(D2)
   - GoThrough(D2)
   - ApproachDoor(D6)
   - OpenDoor(D6)
   - GoThrough(D6)

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates the robot from the HALL to CHAMBRE 1, and then to CHAMBRE 2, using only the necessary doors along the path.
