Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan from the BUREAU to the BAINS.

Explicit Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER
D2: Connects CELLIER and PORCHE
D3: Connects PORCHE and HALL
D4: Connects HALL and WC
D5: Connects LINGERIE and HALL
D6: Connects BUREAU and HALL
D7: Connects HALL and BAINS
D8: Connects BAINS and CHAMBRE PARENTS
D9: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
D10: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
D11: Connects CELLIER and HALL

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in the BUREAU
2. Use D6 to enter the HALL
3. Use D7 to enter the BAINS

Based on these connections and steps, here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the BUREAU to the BAINS, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
