Thank you for providing the floor plan image and the navigation task. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from SEJOUR to CH.1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects SEJOUR to Porche
2. D2 connects CUISINE to Porche
3. D3 connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
4. D4 connects SEJOUR to DEGT
5. D5 connects CH.1 to DEGT
6. D6 connects CH.2 to DEGT
7. D7 connects BAINS to DEGT
8. D8 connects WC to DEGT

Step-by-step navigation plan:
To go from SEJOUR to CH.1, we need to use doors D4 and D5. Here's the detailed plan:

1. ApproachDoor(4)
2. OpenDoor(4)
3. GoThrough(4)
4. ApproachDoor(5)
5. OpenDoor(5)
6. GoThrough(5)

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "SEJOUR",
  "end": "CH.1",
  "actions": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from SEJOUR to CH.1 using only the necessary doors. The robot will start in SEJOUR, go through D4 to enter DEGT, and then use D5 to reach CH.1.
