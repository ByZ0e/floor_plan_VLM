Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the WC to the BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects SEJOUR to Porche
2. D2 connects CUISINE to CELLIER
3. D3 connects CUISINE to SEJOUR
4. D4 connects SEJOUR to DEGT
5. D5 connects CH.1 to DEGT
6. D6 connects CH.2 to DEGT
7. D7 connects BAINS to DEGT
8. D8 connects WC to DEGT

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in WC
2. Use D8 to enter DEGT
3. Use D7 to enter BAINS (destination)

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the WC to the BAINS using only the necessary doors (D8 and D7) and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
