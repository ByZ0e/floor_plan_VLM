Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from CH. PARENTS to TERRASSE COUVERTE.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

Rooms:
1. CH. PARENTS (two sections)
2. DOUCHE
3. CUISINE (multiple sections)
4. CELLIER
5. TERRASSE COUVERTE

Doors and their connections:
D1: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
D2: Connects CUISINE to CELLIER
D3: Connects CH. PARENTS to CUISINE
D4: Connects CH. PARENTS to DOUCHE

Navigation Plan:

To get from CH. PARENTS to TERRASSE COUVERTE, we need to go through the following doors: D3 and D1.

Here's the step-by-step navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from CH. PARENTS to TERRASSE COUVERTE using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
