Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
1. WC connects to DEGT through D8
2. DEGT connects to CH.2 through D6
3. DEGT connects to CH.1 through D5
4. DEGT connects to SEJOUR through D4
5. SEJOUR connects to CUISINE through D3
6. SEJOUR connects to CELLIER through D2
7. SEJOUR connects to Porche through D1
8. BAINS connects to DEGT through D7

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
1. Start in WC
2. ApproachDoor(D8)
3. OpenDoor(D8)
4. GoThrough(D8) to enter DEGT
5. ApproachDoor(D7)
6. OpenDoor(D7)
7. GoThrough(D7) to enter BAINS

Final Navigation Plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "WC",
  "end": "BAINS",
  "actions": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from the WC to the BAINS, using only the necessary doors (D8 and D7) and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
