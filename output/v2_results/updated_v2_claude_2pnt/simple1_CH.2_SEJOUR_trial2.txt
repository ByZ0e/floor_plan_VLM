Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the connections and provide a navigation plan as requested.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects CH.3 to SEJOUR
D2: Connects CH.2 to CH.3
D3: Connects CH.2 to SEJOUR
D4: Connects CH.1 to SEJOUR
D5: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
D6: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE

Now, let's create the navigation plan to go from CH.2 to SEJOUR:

Step-by-step solution:
1. We start in CH.2
2. The most direct path to SEJOUR is through door D3
3. We need to approach D3, open it, and go through it to reach SEJOUR

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from CH.2 to SEJOUR using only the necessary doors and actions.
