Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from CH. PARENTS to TERRASSE COUVERTE.

Rooms and Doors:
1. CH. PARENTS (2 rooms)
2. DOUCHE
3. CUISINE (4 instances, representing one large space)
4. CELLIER
5. TERRASSE COUVERTE

Doors:
D1: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
D2: Connects CUISINE to CELLIER
D3: Connects CH. PARENTS to CUISINE
D4: Connects CH. PARENTS to DOUCHE

Door-Room Connections:
- D1: CUISINE <-> TERRASSE COUVERTE
- D2: CUISINE <-> CELLIER
- D3: CH. PARENTS <-> CUISINE
- D4: CH. PARENTS <-> DOUCHE

Navigation Plan:
To go from CH. PARENTS to TERRASSE COUVERTE, we need to use doors D3 and D1.

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CH. PARENTS
2. Approach door D3
3. Open door D3
4. Go through door D3 to enter CUISINE
5. Approach door D1
6. Open door D1
7. Go through door D1 to reach TERRASSE COUVERTE

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from CH. PARENTS to TERRASSE COUVERTE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
