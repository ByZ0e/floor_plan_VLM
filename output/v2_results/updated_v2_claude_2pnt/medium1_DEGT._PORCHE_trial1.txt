Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms, doors, and their connections, then provide a navigation plan for you to move from DEGT to PORCHE.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:
- D1: Connects SEJOUR to PORCHE
- D2: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
- D3: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
- D4: Connects SEJOUR to DEGT
- D5: Connects CH.1 to DEGT
- D6: Connects CH.2 to DEGT
- D7: Connects BAINS to DEGT
- D8: Connects WC to DEGT

Based on these connections, here's the step-by-step navigation plan from DEGT to PORCHE:

1. ApproachDoor(4)
2. OpenDoor(4)
3. GoThrough(4)
4. ApproachDoor(1)
5. OpenDoor(1)
6. GoThrough(1)

Now, I'll provide the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "DEGT",
  "end": "PORCHE",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan will efficiently guide you from DEGT to PORCHE using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
