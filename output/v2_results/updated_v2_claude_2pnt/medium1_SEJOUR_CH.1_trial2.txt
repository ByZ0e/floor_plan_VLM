Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
- D2: Connects CUISINE to CELLIER
- D3: Connects CUISINE to SEJOUR
- D4: Connects SEJOUR to DEGT
- D5: Connects DEGT to CH.1
- D6: Connects DEGT to CH.2
- D7: Connects DEGT to BAINS
- D8: Connects CUISINE to WC

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
To navigate from SEJOUR to CH.1, we need to use the following doors: D4 and D5.

Here's the detailed plan:

1. Start in SEJOUR
2. ApproachDoor(4)
3. OpenDoor(4)
4. GoThrough(4)
5. ApproachDoor(5)
6. OpenDoor(5)
7. GoThrough(5)

Now, I'll provide the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "SEJOUR",
  "end": "CH.1",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from SEJOUR to CH.1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
