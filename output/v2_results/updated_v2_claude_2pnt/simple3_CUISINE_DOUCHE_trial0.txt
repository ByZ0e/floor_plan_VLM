Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms, doors, and their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the CUISINE to the DOUCHE.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
- D2: Connects CUISINE to CELLIER
- D3: Connects CUISINE to CH. PARENTS
- D4: Connects CH. PARENTS to DOUCHE

Navigation Plan:

To navigate from the CUISINE to the DOUCHE, we need to use doors D3 and D4. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(3)
2. OpenDoor(3)
3. GoThrough(3)
4. ApproachDoor(4)
5. OpenDoor(4)
6. GoThrough(4)

This plan will take you from the CUISINE, through the CH. PARENTS, and finally to the DOUCHE.

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from the CUISINE to the DOUCHE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
