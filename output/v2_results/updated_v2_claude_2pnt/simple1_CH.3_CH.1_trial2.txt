Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms, doors, and their connections, then provide a navigation plan from CH.3 to CH.1.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

Rooms:
- CH.3
- CH.2
- CH.1
- SEJOUR (multiple instances)
- CUISINE

Doors and their connections:
D1: Connects CH.3 to SEJOUR
D2: Connects CH.2 to SEJOUR
D3: Connects CH.2 to SEJOUR
D4: Connects CH.1 to SEJOUR
D5: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
D6: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE

Now, let's create a step-by-step navigation plan from CH.3 to CH.1:

1. Start in CH.3
2. ApproachDoor(1)
3. OpenDoor(1)
4. GoThrough(1) - Now in SEJOUR
5. ApproachDoor(4)
6. OpenDoor(4)
7. GoThrough(4) - Now in CH.1

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from CH.3 to CH.1, using only the necessary doors (D1 and D4) and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
