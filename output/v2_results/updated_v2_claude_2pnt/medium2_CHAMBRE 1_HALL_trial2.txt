Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan for you to move from CHAMBRE 1 to the HALL.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects GARAGE to HALL
- D2: Connects CHAMBRE 1 to HALL
- D3: Connects CHAMBRE 1 to HALL
- D4: Connects BAINS to HALL
- D5: Connects CHAMBRE 3 to HALL
- D6: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to HALL
- D7: Connects CELLIER to HALL
- D8: Connects HALL to Porche

Step-by-step solution:
1. Starting in CHAMBRE 1
2. Use D2 to enter the HALL

Based on this analysis, here's the efficient navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CHAMBRE 1",
  "end": "HALL",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct route from CHAMBRE 1 to the HALL using only the necessary doors. The robot will approach D2, open it, and go through to reach the HALL, completing the navigation task efficiently.
