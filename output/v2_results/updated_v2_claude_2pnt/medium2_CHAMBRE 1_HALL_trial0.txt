Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from CHAMBRE 1 to the HALL.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects GARAGE to HALL
2. D2: Connects CHAMBRE 1 to HALL
3. D3: Connects CHAMBRE 1 to HALL
4. D4: Connects BAINS to HALL
5. D5: Connects CHAMBRE 3 to HALL
6. D6: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to HALL
7. D7: Connects CELLIER to HALL
8. D8: Connects HALL to Porche

Navigation Plan:
To go from CHAMBRE 1 to HALL, we only need to use one door: D2.

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CHAMBRE 1
2. Approach D2
3. Open D2
4. Go through D2 to enter the HALL

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CHAMBRE 1",
  "end": "HALL",
  "actions": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from CHAMBRE 1 to the HALL, using only the necessary door (D2) to complete the navigation task.
