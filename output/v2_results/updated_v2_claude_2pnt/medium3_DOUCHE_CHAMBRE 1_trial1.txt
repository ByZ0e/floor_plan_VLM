Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the DOUCHE to CHAMBRE 1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects GARAGES to CELLIER
2. D2: Connects GARAGES to DOUCHE
3. D3: Connects CELLIER to CUISINE
4. D4: Connects WC to HALL (near CUISINE)
5. D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
6. D6: Connects CUISINE to HALL
7. D7: Connects CUISINE to HALL (lower part)

Now, let's create the navigation plan:

Step 1: Start in DOUCHE
Step 2: Exit DOUCHE to GARAGES
Step 3: Move through GARAGES to reach HALL
Step 4: Navigate through HALL to reach CHAMBRE 1

Based on these steps and the door connections, here's the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the DOUCHE to CHAMBRE 1 using the minimum number of necessary doors. It avoids unnecessary rooms and ensures that each action is correct for traversal to the end goal.
