Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to the CUISINE.

Rooms and Doors:
1. TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE via D1
2. CUISINE (large central room): Connected to TERRASSE COUVERTE via D1, CELLIER via D2, and CH. PARENTS via D3
3. CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE via D2
4. CH. PARENTS: Connected to CUISINE via D3, and DOUCHE via D4
5. DOUCHE: Connected to CH. PARENTS via D4

Navigation Plan:
To go from TERRASSE COUVERTE to CUISINE, we only need to use one door: D1.

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in TERRASSE COUVERTE
2. ApproachDoor(1)
3. OpenDoor(1)
4. GoThrough(1)
5. End in CUISINE

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "TERRASSE COUVERTE",
  "end": "CUISINE",
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(1)",
    "OpenDoor(1)",
    "GoThrough(1)"
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan provides the most efficient route from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to the CUISINE, using only the necessary door (D1) to complete the task.
