Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan from CH.1 to the GARAGE.

Rooms and Doors:
1. CH.1 - connected to Hall via D2
2. CH.2 - connected to Hall via D3
3. BAINS - connected to Hall via D1
4. GARAGE - connected to CUISINE via D4
5. CUISINE - connected to Hall via D5

Navigation Plan:

Starting from CH.1, we need to go through the Hall and CUISINE to reach the GARAGE. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(D2)
2. OpenDoor(D2)
3. GoThrough(D2)
4. ApproachDoor(D5)
5. OpenDoor(D5)
6. GoThrough(D5)
7. ApproachDoor(D4)
8. OpenDoor(D4)
9. GoThrough(D4)

Here's the plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from CH.1 to the GARAGE using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
