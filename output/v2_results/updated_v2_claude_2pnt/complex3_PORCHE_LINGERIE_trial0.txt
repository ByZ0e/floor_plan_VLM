Certainly! I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections based on the floor plan image, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from the PORCHE to the LINGERIE.

Explicit Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER
- D2: Connects PORCHE and CELLIER
- D3: Connects PORCHE and HALL
- D4: Connects HALL and WC
- D5: Connects HALL and LINGERIE
- D6: Connects HALL and BUREAU
- D7: Connects HALL and BAINS
- D8: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE PARENTS
- D9: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
- D10: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
- D11: Connects CELLIER and HALL

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in the PORCHE
2. ApproachDoor(3)
3. OpenDoor(3)
4. GoThrough(3) to enter the HALL
5. ApproachDoor(5)
6. OpenDoor(5)
7. GoThrough(5) to reach the LINGERIE

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "PORCHE",
  "end": "LINGERIE",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the PORCHE to the LINGERIE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
