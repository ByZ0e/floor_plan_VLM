Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the CELLIER to CH. PARENTS.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE to CUISINE
2. D2: Connects CELLIER to CUISINE
3. D3: Connects CUISINE to CH. PARENTS
4. D4: Connects CH. PARENTS to DOUCHE

Now, let's create the navigation plan:

1. Start in CELLIER
2. ApproachDoor(D2)
3. OpenDoor(D2)
4. GoThrough(D2) - Now in CUISINE
5. ApproachDoor(D3)
6. OpenDoor(D3)
7. GoThrough(D3) - Now in CH. PARENTS

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(D2)",
    "OpenDoor(D2)",
    "GoThrough(D2)",
    "ApproachDoor(D3)",
    "OpenDoor(D3)",
    "GoThrough(D3)"
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the CELLIER to CH. PARENTS, using only the necessary doors (D2 and D3) and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
