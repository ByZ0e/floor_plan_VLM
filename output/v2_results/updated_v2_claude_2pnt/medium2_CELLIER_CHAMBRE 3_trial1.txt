Thank you for providing the floor plan image and the navigation task. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects GARAGE and CELLIER
2. D2 connects CHAMBRE 1 and HALL
3. D3 connects HALL and WC
4. D4 connects HALL and BAINS
5. D5 connects HALL and CHAMBRE 3
6. D6 connects HALL and CHAMBRE 2
7. D7 connects CELLIER and HALL
8. D8 connects HALL and Porche

Step-by-step navigation from CELLIER to CHAMBRE 3:
1. Start in CELLIER
2. ApproachDoor(D7)
3. OpenDoor(D7)
4. GoThrough(D7) to enter HALL
5. ApproachDoor(D5)
6. OpenDoor(D5)
7. GoThrough(D5) to enter CHAMBRE 3

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CELLIER",
  "end": "CHAMBRE 3",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the CELLIER to CHAMBRE 3, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
