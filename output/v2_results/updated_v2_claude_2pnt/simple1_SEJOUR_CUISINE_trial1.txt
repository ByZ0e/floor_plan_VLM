Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the SEJOUR to the CUISINE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects SEJOUR to CH.3
2. D2: Connects CH.3 to CH.2
3. D3: Connects CH.2 to SEJOUR
4. D4: Connects SEJOUR to CH.1
5. D5: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
6. D6: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE

For this navigation task, we only need to use one door:
D5: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in SEJOUR
2. Approach D5
3. Open D5
4. Go through D5 to enter CUISINE

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from the SEJOUR to the CUISINE using only the necessary door (D5) without passing through any unnecessary rooms or doors.
