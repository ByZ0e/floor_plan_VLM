Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the GARAGE to CH.2.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

Rooms:
1. GARAGE
2. CUISINE
3. BAINS
4. CH.1
5. CH.2
6. HALL (multiple instances)

Doors:
D1: Connects BAINS to HALL
D2: Connects CH.1 to HALL
D3: Connects CH.2 to HALL
D4: Connects GARAGE to CUISINE
D5: Connects CUISINE to HALL

Door-Room Connections:
- D1: BAINS <-> HALL
- D2: CH.1 <-> HALL
- D3: CH.2 <-> HALL
- D4: GARAGE <-> CUISINE
- D5: CUISINE <-> HALL

Navigation Plan:
To go from GARAGE to CH.2, we need to use doors D4, D5, and D3 in that order.

Here's the step-by-step navigation plan:

1. Start in GARAGE
2. ApproachDoor(D4)
3. OpenDoor(D4)
4. GoThrough(D4)
5. ApproachDoor(D5)
6. OpenDoor(D5)
7. GoThrough(D5)
8. ApproachDoor(D3)
9. OpenDoor(D3)
10. GoThrough(D3)

Now, I'll provide the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "GARAGE",
  "end": "CH.2",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan efficiently guides you from the GARAGE to CH.2 using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
