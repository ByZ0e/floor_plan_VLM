Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the CELLIER to the WC.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

Rooms:
1. CELLIER
2. CUISINE
3. SEJOUR (multiple areas)
4. CH.1 (multiple areas)
5. CH.2 (multiple areas)
6. DEGT (Dégagement - hallway)
7. BAINS
8. WC

Doors and their connections:
D2: Connects CELLIER and CUISINE
D3: Connects CUISINE and SEJOUR
D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
D8: Connects DEGT and WC

Now, let's create the navigation plan from CELLIER to WC:

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CELLIER
2. Use D2 to enter CUISINE
3. Use D3 to enter SEJOUR
4. Use D4 to enter DEGT
5. Use D8 to reach WC

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CELLIER",
  "end": "WC",
  "actions": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan provides the most efficient path from the CELLIER to the WC, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
