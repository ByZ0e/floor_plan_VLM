Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the SEJOUR to the CUISINE.

Rooms and Doors with Connections:

1. SEJOUR: Connected to CH.2 via D3, CH.1 via D4, CUISINE via D5 and D6
2. CH.3: Connected to CH.2 via D2, SEJOUR via D1
3. CH.2: Connected to CH.3 via D2, SEJOUR via D3
4. CH.1: Connected to SEJOUR via D4
5. CUISINE: Connected to SEJOUR via D5 and D6

Navigation Plan:

To move from the SEJOUR to the CUISINE, we only need to use one door. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(5)
2. OpenDoor(5)
3. GoThrough(5)

Now, let's present this in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "SEJOUR",
  "end": "CUISINE",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the SEJOUR to the CUISINE using only the necessary doors. The robot will approach Door 5 (D5), open it, and go through to reach the CUISINE directly from the SEJOUR.
