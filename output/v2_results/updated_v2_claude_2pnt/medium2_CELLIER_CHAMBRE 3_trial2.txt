Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the CELLIER to CHAMBRE 3.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects GARAGE and HALL
2. D2 connects CHAMBRE 1 and HALL
3. D3 connects HALL and WC
4. D4 connects HALL and BAINS
5. D5 connects HALL and CHAMBRE 3
6. D6 connects HALL and CHAMBRE 2
7. D7 connects CELLIER and HALL
8. D8 connects HALL and Porche

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in CELLIER
2. Use D7 to enter HALL
3. Use D5 to enter CHAMBRE 3

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the CELLIER to CHAMBRE 3, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
