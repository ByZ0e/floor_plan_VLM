Thank you for providing the floor plan. Let me first list out the rooms and doors with their connections based on the image:

Room and Door Connections:
1. WC connects to Hall through D3
2. Hall connects to Chambre 1 through D2
3. Hall connects to Bains through D4
4. Hall connects to Chambre 3 through D5
5. Hall connects to Chambre 2 through D6
6. Hall connects to Cellier through D7
7. Hall connects to Porche through D8
8. Garage connects to Cellier through D1

Now, let's create a step-by-step navigation plan from WC to Chambre 2:

1. Start in WC
2. ApproachDoor(D3)
3. OpenDoor(D3)
4. GoThrough(D3) - Now in Hall
5. ApproachDoor(D6)
6. OpenDoor(D6)
7. GoThrough(D6) - Now in Chambre 2

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"}
  ]
}
```

This path is the most efficient route from WC to Chambre 2, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
