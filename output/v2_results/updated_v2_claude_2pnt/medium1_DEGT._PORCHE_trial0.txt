Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. Let me start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections based on the image:

Room and Door Connections:
1. DEGT connects to SEJOUR through D4
2. DEGT connects to CH.2 through D6
3. DEGT connects to BAINS through D7
4. SEJOUR connects to CUISINE through D3
5. SEJOUR connects to CELLIER through D2
6. CELLIER connects to PORCHE through D1

Now, let's create a step-by-step navigation plan to go from DEGT to PORCHE:

1. Start in DEGT
2. ApproachDoor(D4)
3. OpenDoor(D4)
4. GoThrough(D4) - Now in SEJOUR
5. ApproachDoor(D3)
6. OpenDoor(D3)
7. GoThrough(D3) - Now in CUISINE
8. ApproachDoor(D2)
9. OpenDoor(D2)
10. GoThrough(D2) - Now in CELLIER
11. ApproachDoor(D1)
12. OpenDoor(D1)
13. GoThrough(D1) - Now at PORCHE

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "DEGT",
  "end": "PORCHE",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides an efficient route from DEGT to PORCHE, using only the necessary doors and rooms along the path.
