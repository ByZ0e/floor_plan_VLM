Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan.

Rooms and Door Connections:
1. CH.2 - connected to CH.3 via D2
2. CH.3 - connected to CH.2 via D2, connected to SEJOUR via D1
3. SEJOUR (large central area) - connected to CH.3 via D1, connected to CH.2 via D3, connected to CH.1 via D4, connected to CUISINE via D6
4. CH.1 - connected to SEJOUR via D4
5. CUISINE - connected to SEJOUR via D6

Now, for the navigation plan from CH.2 to SEJOUR:

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CH.2
2. Approach and go through D2 to enter CH.3
3. From CH.3, approach and go through D1 to enter SEJOUR

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CH.2",
  "end": "SEJOUR",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from CH.2 to SEJOUR using only the necessary doors. The robot will start in CH.2, go through D2 to enter CH.3, and then go through D1 to reach the SEJOUR.
