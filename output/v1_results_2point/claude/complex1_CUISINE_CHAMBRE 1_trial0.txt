Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan to get from the CUISINE to CHAMBRE 1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D7
2. HALL: Connected to CUISINE (D7), PORCHE (D6), CHAMBRE 2 (D5), CHAMBRE 1 (D4), WC (D3), BAINS (D2), CELLIER (D1)
3. CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D4
4. CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL via D5
5. WC: Connected to HALL via D3
6. BAINS: Connected to HALL via D2
7. CELLIER: Connected to HALL via D1, connected to GARAGE via D9
8. GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER via D9
9. PORCHE: Connected to HALL via D6
10. TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE via D8

Now, for the navigation plan from CUISINE to CHAMBRE 1:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently guides you from the CUISINE to CHAMBRE 1 using only the necessary doors. You'll start by exiting the CUISINE through D7 into the HALL, then proceed directly to CHAMBRE 1 through D4. This is the most direct route based on the floor plan provided.
