Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the CELLIER to CH. PARENTS.

Rooms and Doors:
1. CELLIER - connected to CUISINE via D2
2. CUISINE (large central room) - connected to CELLIER via D2, TERRASSE COUVERTE via D1, and CH. PARENTS via D3
3. TERRASSE COUVERTE - connected to CUISINE via D1
4. CH. PARENTS - connected to CUISINE via D3, and DOUCHE via D4
5. DOUCHE - connected to CH. PARENTS via D4

Now, let's create the navigation plan:

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CELLIER
2. Use D2 to enter CUISINE
3. Cross CUISINE
4. Use D3 to enter CH. PARENTS

JSON format navigation plan:

```json
{
  "start": "CELLIER",
  "end": "CH. PARENTS",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from CELLIER to CH. PARENTS, using only the necessary doors (D2 and D3) and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
