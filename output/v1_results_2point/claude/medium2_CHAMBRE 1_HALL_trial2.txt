Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from CHAMBRE 1 to the HALL.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CHAMBRE 1 connects to HALL via D2
2. HALL connects to CELLIER via D7
3. CELLIER connects to GARAGE via D1
4. HALL connects to CHAMBRE 2 via D6
5. HALL connects to CHAMBRE 3 and BAINS via D5
6. BAINS connects to WC via D3
7. HALL connects to Porche via D8
8. GARAGE connects to outside via D1 (but not relevant for this path)

Navigation Plan:
To go from CHAMBRE 1 to HALL, we only need to use one door: D2. Here's the detailed plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D2"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D2"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D2"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from CHAMBRE 1 to the HALL using only the necessary door D2. No other doors or rooms need to be traversed for this particular route.
