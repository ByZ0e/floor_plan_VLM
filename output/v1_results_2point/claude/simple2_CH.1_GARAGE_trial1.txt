Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the room and door connections, then provide a navigation plan from CH.1 to the GARAGE.

Room and Door Connections:
- CH.1 connects to the hall via D2
- Hall connects to BAINS via D1
- Hall connects to CH.2 via D3
- Hall connects to GARAGE via D4
- CUISINE connects to hall via D5

Navigation Plan:
To go from CH.1 to the GARAGE, we need to use doors D2 and D4. Here's the step-by-step plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from CH.1 to the GARAGE using only the necessary doors. The path goes through the hall, which connects CH.1 to the GARAGE. No unnecessary rooms or doors are included in this plan.
