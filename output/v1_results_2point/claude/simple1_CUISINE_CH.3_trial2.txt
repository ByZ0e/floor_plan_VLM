Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan to get from the CUISINE to CH.3.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CUISINE connects to SEJOUR through D5
2. SEJOUR connects to CH.1 through D4
3. SEJOUR connects to CH.2 through D3
4. CH.2 connects to CH.3 through D2
5. CH.3 connects to SEJOUR through D1

Now, let's create the navigation plan:

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CUISINE
2. Use D5 to enter SEJOUR
3. Cross SEJOUR to reach D3
4. Use D3 to enter CH.2
5. Cross CH.2 to reach D2
6. Use D2 to enter CH.3

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2}
  ]
}
```

This path efficiently navigates from the CUISINE to CH.3 using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
