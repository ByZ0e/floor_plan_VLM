Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from CHAMBRE PARENTS to CELLIER.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CHAMBRE PARENTS - D8 - HALL
2. HALL - D7 - BAINS
3. HALL - D6 - BUREAU
4. HALL - D5 - LINGERIE
5. LINGERIE - D4 - WC
6. LINGERIE - D3 - HALL (near PORCHE)
7. HALL (near PORCHE) - D2 - CELLIER
8. GARAGE - D1 - CELLIER
9. HALL - D9 - CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
10. HALL - D10 - CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
11. CELLIER - D11 - HALL (lower part)

Navigation Plan:
To go from CHAMBRE PARENTS to CELLIER, we need to use the following sequence of actions:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2}
  ]
}
```

This path takes you from CHAMBRE PARENTS through the HALL, LINGERIE, another HALL near the PORCHE, and finally into the CELLIER. It's the most direct route based on the floor plan provided.
