Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the CUISINE to CH.1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D5, connected to GARAGE via D4
2. GARAGE: Connected to CUISINE via D4
3. HALL: Connected to CUISINE via D5, connected to CH.2 via D3, connected to CH.1 via D2, connected to BAINS via D1
4. CH.2: Connected to HALL via D3
5. CH.1: Connected to HALL via D2
6. BAINS: Connected to HALL via D1

Now, let's create the navigation plan:

```json
{
  "start": "CUISINE",
  "end": "CH.1",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the CUISINE to CH.1 using the necessary doors. The path goes through the HALL, which connects these two rooms. The plan avoids any unnecessary detours through other rooms or doors.
