Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and their door connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the CELLIER to CHAMBRE 3.

Room and Door Connections:
1. GARAGE - D1 connects to HALL
2. CELLIER - D7 connects to HALL
3. CHAMBRE 1 - D2 connects to HALL
4. BAINS - D4 connects to HALL
5. WC - D3 connects to HALL
6. CHAMBRE 2 - D6 connects to HALL
7. CHAMBRE 3 - D5 connects to HALL
8. HALL - Central area connecting all rooms
9. Porche - D8 connects to HALL

Navigation Plan:
To go from CELLIER to CHAMBRE 3, we need to go through the HALL. Here's the step-by-step plan:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently take you from the CELLIER to CHAMBRE 3 using only the necessary doors. You'll exit the CELLIER through D7, enter the HALL, and then enter CHAMBRE 3 through D5.
