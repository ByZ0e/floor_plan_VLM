Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the WC to the CUISINE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. WC:
   - D4 connects to HALL
2. HALL:
   - D4 connects to WC
   - D2 connects to DOUCHE
   - D5 connects to CHAMBRE 1
   - D6 connects to CUISINE
3. DOUCHE:
   - D2 connects to HALL
4. CHAMBRE 1:
   - D5 connects to HALL
5. CUISINE:
   - D6 connects to HALL
   - D3 connects to CELLIER
6. CELLIER:
   - D3 connects to CUISINE
7. GARAGES:
   - D1 connects to HALL (not needed for this navigation)

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan from WC to CUISINE:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the WC to the CUISINE using the necessary doors. The plan avoids any unnecessary rooms or doors, providing a direct path to your destination.
