Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the GARAGES to the CELLIER.

Room and Door Connections:
1. GARAGES connects to HALL via D1
2. HALL connects to WC via D4
3. HALL connects to DOUCHE via D2
4. HALL connects to CHAMBRE 1 via D5
5. HALL connects to CUISINE via D6
6. CUISINE connects to CELLIER via D3
7. CUISINE connects to HALL via D7

Now, let's create the navigation plan from GARAGES to CELLIER:

{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"}
  ]
}

This navigation plan will efficiently guide you from the GARAGES to the CELLIER using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
