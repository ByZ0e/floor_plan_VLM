Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan to get from CH.1 to the GARAGE.

Rooms and Doors:
1. CH.1 - connected to HALL via D2
2. CH.2 - connected to HALL via D3
3. BAINS (bathroom) - connected to HALL via D1
4. GARAGE - connected to HALL via D4
5. CUISINE (kitchen) - connected to HALL via D5
6. HALL - central area connecting all rooms

Navigation Plan:
To go from CH.1 to GARAGE, we need to go through the HALL. Here's the step-by-step plan:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently take you from CH.1 to the GARAGE using only the necessary doors. The robot will exit CH.1 through D2, enter the HALL, and then enter the GARAGE through D4.
