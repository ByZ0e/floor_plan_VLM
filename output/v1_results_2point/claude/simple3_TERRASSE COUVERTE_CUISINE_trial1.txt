Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan to get from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to the CUISINE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. TERRASSE COUVERTE - connected to CUISINE via D1
2. CUISINE (large central room) - connected to:
   - TERRASSE COUVERTE via D1
   - CELLIER via D2
   - CH. PARENTS via D3
3. CELLIER - connected to CUISINE via D2
4. CH. PARENTS - connected to CUISINE via D3
5. DOUCHE - connected to CH. PARENTS via D4

Navigation Plan:
To get from TERRASSE COUVERTE to CUISINE, we only need to use one door: D1.

Here's the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "TERRASSE COUVERTE",
  "end": "CUISINE",
  "path": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to the CUISINE using the most direct path available.
