Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and their door connections, then provide the navigation plan to get from CHAMBRE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CHAMBRE 1 - D6 connects to HALL
2. HALL - D4 connects to WC, D3 connects to BAINS, D2 connects to CHAMBRE 2, D7 connects to CUISINE
3. CUISINE - D8 connects to TERRASSE COUVERTE, D7 connects to HALL
4. TERRASSE COUVERTE - D8 connects to CUISINE

Now, let's create the navigation plan:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from CHAMBRE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
