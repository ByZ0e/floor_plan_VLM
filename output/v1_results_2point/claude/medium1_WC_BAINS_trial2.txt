Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan to get from the WC to the BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
- WC is connected to DEGT via D8
- DEGT is connected to CH.2 via D6
- DEGT is connected to SEJOUR via D4
- SEJOUR is connected to CUISINE via D3
- CUISINE is connected to CELLIER via D2

Navigation Plan:

To go from WC to BAINS, we need to follow this path: WC -> DEGT -> BAINS

Here's the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D8"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D8"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D8"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D7"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D7"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D7"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the WC to the BAINS using only the necessary doors. The path avoids any unnecessary rooms or doors, providing a direct route to your destination.
