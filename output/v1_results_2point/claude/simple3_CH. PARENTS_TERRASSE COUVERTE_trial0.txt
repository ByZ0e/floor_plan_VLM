Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from CH. PARENTS to TERRASSE COUVERTE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CH. PARENTS - connected to CUISINE via D3
2. CUISINE - connected to CELLIER via D2, to CH. PARENTS via D3, and to DOUCHE via D4
3. CELLIER - connected to CUISINE via D2
4. DOUCHE - connected to CUISINE via D4
5. TERRASSE COUVERTE - connected to CUISINE via D1

Now, let's create the navigation plan:

{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor(3)", "description": "Move towards D3 from CH. PARENTS"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor(3)", "description": "Open door D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough(3)", "description": "Enter the CUISINE from CH. PARENTS"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor(1)", "description": "Move towards D1 in the CUISINE"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor(1)", "description": "Open door D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough(1)", "description": "Enter the TERRASSE COUVERTE from CUISINE"}
  ]
}

This plan provides the most efficient route from CH. PARENTS to TERRASSE COUVERTE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
