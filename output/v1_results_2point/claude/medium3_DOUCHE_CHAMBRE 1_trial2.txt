Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first describe the rooms and doors, then provide the navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
- DOUCHE: Connected to HALL via D2
- HALL: Connected to WC via D4, CHAMBRE 1 via D5, and CUISINE via D6
- CUISINE: Connected to CELLIER via D3 and HALL via D7
- CELLIER: Connected to GARAGES via D1
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D5

Now, for the navigation plan from DOUCHE to CHAMBRE 1:

1. ApproachDoor(D2)
2. OpenDoor(D2)
3. GoThrough(D2)
4. ApproachDoor(D5)
5. OpenDoor(D5)
6. GoThrough(D5)

Here's the plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "DOUCHE",
  "end": "CHAMBRE 1",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from the DOUCHE to CHAMBRE 1, using only the necessary doors (D2 and D5) and passing through the HALL as an intermediate step. The plan avoids any unnecessary rooms or doors, ensuring a correct and optimal path to the destination.
