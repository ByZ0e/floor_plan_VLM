Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to the CUISINE.

Rooms and Doors:
1. TERRASSE COUVERTE - connected to CUISINE via D1
2. CUISINE (large central room) - connected to TERRASSE COUVERTE via D1, CELLIER via D2, and CH. PARENTS via D3
3. CELLIER - connected to CUISINE via D2
4. CH. PARENTS - connected to CUISINE via D3, and DOUCHE via D4
5. DOUCHE - connected to CH. PARENTS via D4

Navigation Plan:
To go from TERRASSE COUVERTE to CUISINE, we only need to use one door: D1.

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "TERRASSE COUVERTE",
  "end": "CUISINE",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to the CUISINE using the most direct path available.
