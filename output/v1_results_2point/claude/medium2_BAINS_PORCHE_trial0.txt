Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the BAINS to the PORCHE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. BAINS: Connected to HALL via D4
2. CHAMBRE 3: Connected to HALL via D5
3. CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL via D6
4. CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D2
5. CELLIER: Connected to HALL via D7
6. GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER via D1
7. HALL: Connected to PORCHE via D8

Navigation Plan:
To go from BAINS to PORCHE, we need to follow this path: BAINS -> HALL -> PORCHE

Here's the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the BAINS to the PORCHE using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
