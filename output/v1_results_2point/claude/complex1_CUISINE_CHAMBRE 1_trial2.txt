Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan to get from CUISINE to CHAMBRE 1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
2. D2: Connects BAINS to HALL
3. D3: Connects WC to HALL
4. D4: Connects CHAMBRE 1 to HALL
5. D5: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to HALL
6. D6: Connects PORCHE to HALL
7. D7: Connects CUISINE to HALL
8. D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
9. D9: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE

Navigation Plan:
To go from CUISINE to CHAMBRE 1, we need to use two doors: D7 and D4. Here's the step-by-step plan:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently take you from CUISINE to CHAMBRE 1 using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
