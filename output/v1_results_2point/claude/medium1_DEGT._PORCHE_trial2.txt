Certainly! I'll provide you with a detailed navigation plan based on the floor plan image. First, let's list the rooms and doors with their connections:

Rooms and Door Connections:
- DEGT: Connected to SEJOUR via D4, to CH.2 via D6
- SEJOUR: Connected to DEGT via D4, to CUISINE via D3, to CELLIER via D2
- CUISINE: Connected to SEJOUR via D3
- CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE via D2
- CH.2: Connected to DEGT via D6
- PORCHE: Connected to SEJOUR via D1

Now, for the navigation plan from DEGT to PORCHE:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

Explanation of the navigation plan:
1. Start in DEGT
2. Approach Door 4 (D4), which connects DEGT to SEJOUR
3. Open Door 4
4. Go through Door 4 to enter SEJOUR
5. In SEJOUR, approach Door 1 (D1), which connects SEJOUR to PORCHE
6. Open Door 1
7. Go through Door 1 to reach PORCHE

This plan provides the most efficient path from DEGT to PORCHE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours. The path goes through SEJOUR, which is the only room needed to reach the destination from the starting point.
