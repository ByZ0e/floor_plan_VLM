Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CH.3 connects to SEJOUR through D1
2. CH.2 connects to SEJOUR through D2 and D3
3. CH.1 connects to SEJOUR through D4
4. CUISINE connects to SEJOUR through D5 and D6

Now, for the navigation task from CH.3 to CH.1:

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CH.3
2. Use D1 to enter SEJOUR
3. Cross SEJOUR
4. Use D4 to enter CH.1

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CH.3",
  "end": "CH.1",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from CH.3 to CH.1 using only the necessary doors. It avoids any unnecessary detours through other rooms or doors.
