Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first describe the rooms and doors, then provide the navigation plan.

Room and Door Descriptions:
- CH.1 is connected to the larger SEJOUR area through door D4
- CH.2 is connected to the larger SEJOUR area through door D3
- CH.3 is connected to the larger SEJOUR area through door D2
- The CUISINE (kitchen) is connected to the SEJOUR through door D6
- Door D5 connects two parts of the SEJOUR
- Door D1 connects CH.3 to a smaller SEJOUR area

For the navigation task from CH.1 to CH.2, here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(D4)
2. OpenDoor(D4)
3. GoThrough(D4)
4. ApproachDoor(D3)
5. OpenDoor(D3)
6. GoThrough(D3)

Now, I'll provide this plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CH.1",
  "end": "CH.2",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from CH.1 to CH.2, using only the necessary doors (D4 and D3) and avoiding any unnecessary detours through other rooms or doors.
