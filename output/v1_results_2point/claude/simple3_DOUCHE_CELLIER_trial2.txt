Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan.

Rooms and Doors:
- DOUCHE: connected to CUISINE via D4
- CUISINE: connected to DOUCHE via D4, CH. PARENTS via D3, and another CUISINE via D2
- CH. PARENTS: connected to CUISINE via D3
- CELLIER: connected to CUISINE via D2
- TERRASSE COUVERTE: connected to CUISINE via D1

Now, for the navigation plan from DOUCHE to CELLIER:

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in DOUCHE
2. Use D4 to enter CUISINE
3. Cross CUISINE
4. Use D2 to enter CELLIER

Here's the action plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from DOUCHE to CELLIER, using only the necessary doors (D4 and D2) and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
