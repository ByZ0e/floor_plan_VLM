Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the room and door connections, then provide a navigation plan from SEJOUR to CH.1.

Explicit Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects SEJOUR to Porche
- D2: Connects CUISINE to CELLIER
- D3: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
- D4: Connects SEJOUR to DEGT
- D5: Connects CH.1 to DEGT
- D6: Connects CH.2 to DEGT
- D7: Connects BAINS to DEGT
- D8: Connects WC to DEGT

Step-by-step navigation plan from SEJOUR to CH.1:

1. ApproachDoor(4)
2. OpenDoor(4)
3. GoThrough(4)
4. ApproachDoor(5)
5. OpenDoor(5)
6. GoThrough(5)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5}
  ]
}
```

This path takes you from SEJOUR through the DEGT (hallway) and directly into CH.1, using only the necessary doors for the most efficient route.
