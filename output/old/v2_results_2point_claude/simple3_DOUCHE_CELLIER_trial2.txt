Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms, doors, and their connections, then provide a navigation plan from the DOUCHE to the CELLIER.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

Rooms:
1. DOUCHE
2. CH. PARENTS (2 instances)
3. CUISINE (4 instances)
4. CELLIER
5. TERRASSE COUVERTE

Doors and their connections:
D1: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE and CUISINE
D2: Connects CUISINE and CELLIER
D3: Connects CH. PARENTS and CUISINE
D4: Connects DOUCHE and CUISINE

Now, I'll create a step-by-step navigation plan from DOUCHE to CELLIER:

{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2}
  ]
}

This plan efficiently navigates you from the DOUCHE to the CELLIER using only the necessary doors (D4 and D2) and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
