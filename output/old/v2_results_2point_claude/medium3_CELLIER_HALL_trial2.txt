Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects GARAGES to CELLIER
- D2: Connects GARAGES to HALL (near DOUCHE)
- D3: Connects CELLIER to CUISINE
- D4: Connects WC to HALL
- D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
- D6: Connects HALL to CUISINE
- D7: Connects CUISINE to HALL (lower part)

Now, for the navigation task from CELLIER to HALL:

The most efficient path is to use D3 to go from CELLIER to CUISINE, then use D7 to reach the HALL. Here's the detailed plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 7
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 7
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 7
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates you from the CELLIER to the HALL using the minimum number of necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
