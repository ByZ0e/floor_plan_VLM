Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms and doors, create a list of connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the GARAGE to the BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D9: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER
2. D1: Connects CELLIER and HALL
3. D2: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 2
4. D5: Connects HALL and PORCHE
5. D3: Connects HALL and BAINS
6. D4: Connects HALL and WC
7. D6: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 1
8. D7: Connects HALL and CUISINE
9. D8: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan from the GARAGE to the BAINS:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 9},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from the GARAGE to the BAINS, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
