Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the room and door connections, then provide a navigation plan from the GARAGE to the BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects GARAGE to HALL
- D2: Connects CHAMBRE1 to HALL
- D3: Connects HALL to WC
- D4: Connects HALL to BAINS
- D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE3
- D6: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE2
- D7: Connects CELLIER to HALL
- D8: Connects HALL to Porche

Now, I'll create a step-by-step navigation plan from the GARAGE to the BAINS:

{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}

This plan efficiently navigates from the GARAGE to the BAINS using only the necessary doors. The robot will start in the GARAGE, go through D1 to enter the HALL, and then use D4 to reach the BAINS. This is the most direct and efficient route based on the provided floor plan.
