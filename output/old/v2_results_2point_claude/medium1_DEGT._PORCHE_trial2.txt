Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms and doors, create a list of connections, and then provide a navigation plan from DEGT to PORCHE.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects SEJOUR to PORCHE
D2: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
D3: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
D4: Connects SEJOUR to DEGT
D5: Connects CH.1 to DEGT
D6: Connects CH.2 to DEGT
D7: Connects BAINS to DEGT
D8: Connects WC to DEGT

Now, I'll create a step-by-step navigation plan from DEGT to PORCHE:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from DEGT to PORCHE using the necessary doors. The robot will start in DEGT, go through D4 to enter SEJOUR, and then use D1 to reach PORCHE. This is the most direct and efficient path based on the provided floor plan.
