Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from CHAMBRE 2 to WC.

Explicit Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to HALL
D2: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to HALL
D3: Connects HALL to BAINS
D4: Connects HALL to WC
D5: Connects HALL to PORCHE
D6: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE
D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER

Now, for the navigation plan from CHAMBRE 2 to WC:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CHAMBRE 2 to WC using the most direct path. It starts by exiting CHAMBRE 2 through door D2 into the HALL, then immediately approaches and goes through door D4 to enter the WC. This route avoids any unnecessary doors or rooms, providing the most straightforward path to the destination.
