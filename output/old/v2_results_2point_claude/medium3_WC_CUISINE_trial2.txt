Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
- WC: Connected to Hall via D4
- Hall: Connected to WC via D4, Douche via D2, Chambre 1 via D5, Cuisine via D6
- Douche: Connected to Hall via D2
- Chambre 1: Connected to Hall via D5
- Cuisine: Connected to Hall via D6, Cellier via D3
- Cellier: Connected to Cuisine via D3, Garages via D1
- Garages: Connected to Cellier via D1

Navigation Plan:
To go from WC to Cuisine, we need to follow these steps:

1. ApproachDoor(D4)
2. OpenDoor(D4)
3. GoThrough(D4)
4. ApproachDoor(D6)
5. OpenDoor(D6)
6. GoThrough(D6)

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "WC",
  "end": "CUISINE",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the WC to the Cuisine, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
