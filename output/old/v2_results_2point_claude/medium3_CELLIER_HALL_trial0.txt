Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the CELLIER to the HALL.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects GARAGES to CELLIER
- D2: Connects GARAGES to DOUCHE
- D3: Connects CELLIER to CUISINE
- D4: Connects WC to HALL
- D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
- D6: Connects HALL to CUISINE
- D7: Connects CUISINE to HALL

Now, for the navigation plan from CELLIER to HALL:

The most efficient path from CELLIER to HALL is through D3 and D6. Here's the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 6
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 6
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 6
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently guide you from the CELLIER to the HALL using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
