Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the connections and provide a navigation plan as requested.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
D2: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to HALL
D3: Connects HALL to BAINS
D4: Connects HALL to WC
D5: Connects HALL to PORCHE
D6: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
D7: Connects CUISINE to HALL
D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER

Based on these connections, here's the navigation plan to go from CELLIER to HALL:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This is the most efficient path from CELLIER to HALL. It only requires using one door (D1) which directly connects these two areas. No other doors or rooms need to be traversed for this particular navigation task.
