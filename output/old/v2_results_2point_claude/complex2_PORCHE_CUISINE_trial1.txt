Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms, doors, and their connections, then provide a navigation plan from the PORCHE to the CUISINE.

Explicit Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects CELLIER and HALL
D2: Connects CHAMBRE 2 and HALL
D3: Connects HALL and BAINS
D4: Connects HALL and WC
D5: Connects PORCHE and HALL
D6: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 1
D7: Connects HALL and CUISINE
D8: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER

Based on these connections, here's the efficient navigation plan from PORCHE to CUISINE:

{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7}
  ]
}

This plan takes you directly from the PORCHE to the CUISINE using only the necessary doors. It avoids any unnecessary detours through other rooms or doors.
