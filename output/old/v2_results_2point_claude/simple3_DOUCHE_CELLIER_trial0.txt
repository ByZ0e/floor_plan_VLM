Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms and doors, then provide you with a navigation plan to get from the DOUCHE to the CELLIER.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

Rooms:
1. DOUCHE
2. CH. PARENTS (two connected rooms)
3. CUISINE (large central area)
4. CELLIER
5. TERRASSE COUVERTE

Doors and their connections:
D1: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE and CUISINE
D2: Connects CUISINE and CELLIER
D3: Connects CH. PARENTS and CUISINE
D4: Connects DOUCHE and CUISINE

Now, let's create the navigation plan:

{
  "start": "DOUCHE",
  "end": "CELLIER",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2}
  ]
}

This navigation plan will efficiently guide you from the DOUCHE to the CELLIER using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours. The plan starts in the DOUCHE, goes through the CUISINE, and ends in the CELLIER, using only the required doors D4 and D2.
