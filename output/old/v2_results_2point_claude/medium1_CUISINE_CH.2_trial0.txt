Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the CUISINE to CH.2.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
2. D2 connects CUISINE and CELLIER
3. D3 connects CUISINE and SEJOUR
4. D4 connects SEJOUR and DEGT
5. D5 connects CH.1 and DEGT
6. D6 connects DEGT and CH.2
7. D7 connects DEGT and BAINS
8. D8 connects CUISINE and WC

Navigation Plan:
To go from CUISINE to CH.2, we need to use the following doors: D3, D4, and D6.

Here's the step-by-step navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently guide you from the CUISINE to CH.2 using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
