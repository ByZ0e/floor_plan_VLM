Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and their door connections, then provide the navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
1. GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER via D9
2. CELLIER: Connected to GARAGE via D9, to HALL via D1
3. CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL via D2
4. HALL: Connected to CELLIER via D1, CHAMBRE 2 via D2, BAINS via D3, CHAMBRE 1 via D6, CUISINE via D7
5. BAINS: Connected to HALL via D3
6. WC: Connected to HALL via D4
7. PORCHE: Connected to HALL via D5
8. CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D6
9. CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D7, to TERRASSE COUVERTE via D8
10. TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE via D8

Now, for the navigation plan from GARAGE to BAINS:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently guides you from the GARAGE to the BAINS using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
