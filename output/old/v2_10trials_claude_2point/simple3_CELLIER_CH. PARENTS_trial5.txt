Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the CELLIER to the CH. PARENTS.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

Rooms:
1. CELLIER (two instances)
2. CUISINE (multiple instances, appears to be a large open space)
3. TERRASSE COUVERTE
4. CH. PARENTS
5. DOUCHE

Doors and their connections:
D1: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE to CUISINE
D2: Connects upper CELLIER to CUISINE
D3: Connects CUISINE to CH. PARENTS
D4: Connects CUISINE to DOUCHE

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan to go from CELLIER to CH. PARENTS:

1. ApproachDoor(D2)
2. OpenDoor(D2)
3. GoThrough(D2)
4. ApproachDoor(D3)
5. OpenDoor(D3)
6. GoThrough(D3)

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the CELLIER to the CH. PARENTS using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
