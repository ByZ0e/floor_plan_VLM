Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a detailed navigation plan for you to move from CH. PARENTS to TERRASSE COUVERTE.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

Rooms:
1. CH. PARENTS
2. CUISINE (multiple areas)
3. DOUCHE
4. CELLIER (two separate areas)
5. TERRASSE COUVERTE

Doors and their connections:
D1: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
D2: Connects CUISINE to CELLIER
D3: Connects CUISINE to CH. PARENTS
D4: Connects CUISINE to DOUCHE

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CH. PARENTS
2. Use D3 to enter CUISINE
3. Use D1 to reach TERRASSE COUVERTE

Now, I'll provide the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently guide you from CH. PARENTS to TERRASSE COUVERTE using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
