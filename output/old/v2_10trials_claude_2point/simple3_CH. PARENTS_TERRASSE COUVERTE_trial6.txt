Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from CH. PARENTS to TERRASSE COUVERTE.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

Rooms:
1. CH. PARENTS
2. CUISINE (multiple instances)
3. DOUCHE
4. CELLIER (two instances)
5. TERRASSE COUVERTE

Doors and their connections:
D1: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
D2: Connects CUISINE to CELLIER
D3: Connects CUISINE to CH. PARENTS
D4: Connects CUISINE to DOUCHE

Now, I'll create a step-by-step navigation plan:

1. Start in CH. PARENTS
2. Approach and open D3
3. Go through D3 to enter CUISINE
4. Approach and open D1
5. Go through D1 to reach TERRASSE COUVERTE

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from CH. PARENTS to TERRASSE COUVERTE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
