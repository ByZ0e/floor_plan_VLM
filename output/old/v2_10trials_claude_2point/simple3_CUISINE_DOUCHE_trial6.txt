Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list the rooms and doors with their connections, then create a navigation plan based on that information.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CUISINE connects to TERRASSE COUVERTE via D1
2. CUISINE connects to CELLIER via D2
3. CUISINE connects to CH. PARENTS via D3
4. CH. PARENTS connects to DOUCHE via D4

Now, let's create the navigation plan to go from CUISINE to DOUCHE:

Step 1: ApproachDoor(3)
Step 2: OpenDoor(3)
Step 3: GoThrough(3)
Step 4: ApproachDoor(4)
Step 5: OpenDoor(4)
Step 6: GoThrough(4)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the CUISINE to the DOUCHE using the necessary doors D3 and D4. It avoids unnecessary rooms and doors, providing a direct path to the destination.
