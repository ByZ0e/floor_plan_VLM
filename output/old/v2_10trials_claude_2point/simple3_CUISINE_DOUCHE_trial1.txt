Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the CUISINE to the DOUCHE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CUISINE connects to TERRASSE COUVERTE via D1
2. CUISINE connects to CELLIER via D2
3. CUISINE connects to CH. PARENTS via D3
4. CH. PARENTS connects to DOUCHE via D4

Step-by-step navigation plan:

1. Start in CUISINE
2. ApproachDoor(D3)
3. OpenDoor(D3)
4. GoThrough(D3) to enter CH. PARENTS
5. ApproachDoor(D4)
6. OpenDoor(D4)
7. GoThrough(D4) to enter DOUCHE

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the CUISINE to the DOUCHE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
