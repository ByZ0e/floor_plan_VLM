Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to the CUISINE.

Rooms and Doors:
1. TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE via D1
2. CUISINE (large room with multiple labels): Connected to TERRASSE COUVERTE via D1, to CELLIER via D2, and to CH. PARENTS via D3
3. CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE via D2
4. CH. PARENTS: Connected to CUISINE via D3, and to DOUCHE via D4
5. DOUCHE: Connected to CH. PARENTS via D4

Navigation Plan:
To get from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to the CUISINE, we only need to use one door. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(1)
2. OpenDoor(1)
3. GoThrough(1)

This sequence will take you directly from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to the CUISINE.

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "TERRASSE COUVERTE",
  "end": "CUISINE",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan is the most efficient route from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to the CUISINE, using only the necessary door (D1) to complete the task.
