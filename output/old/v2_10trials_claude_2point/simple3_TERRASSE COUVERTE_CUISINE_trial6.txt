Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to the CUISINE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. TERRASSE COUVERTE <-> D1 <-> CUISINE
2. CUISINE <-> D2 <-> CELLIER
3. CUISINE <-> D3 <-> CH. PARENTS
4. CUISINE <-> D4 <-> DOUCHE

Now, let's create the navigation plan:

Step 1: We start in the TERRASSE COUVERTE.
Step 2: We need to go through D1 to enter the CUISINE.

Here's the detailed action plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to the CUISINE using only the necessary door (D1). No other doors need to be used for this particular route.
