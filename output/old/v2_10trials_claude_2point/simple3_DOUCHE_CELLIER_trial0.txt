Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the DOUCHE to the CELLIER.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE and CUISINE
D2: Connects CUISINE and CELLIER
D3: Connects CUISINE and CH. PARENTS
D4: Connects CUISINE and DOUCHE

Step-by-step navigation plan:

1. Start in DOUCHE
2. Use D4 to enter CUISINE
3. From CUISINE, use D2 to enter CELLIER

Now, I'll provide the detailed action sequence in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the DOUCHE to the CELLIER using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours. The robot will start in the DOUCHE, go through D4 to enter the CUISINE, and then use D2 to reach the final destination in the CELLIER.
