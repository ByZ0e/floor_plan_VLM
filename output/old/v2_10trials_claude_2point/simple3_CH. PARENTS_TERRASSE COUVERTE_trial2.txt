Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from CH. PARENTS to TERRASSE COUVERTE.

Rooms and Doors:
1. CH. PARENTS: Connected to CUISINE via D3
2. CUISINE: Connected to CH. PARENTS via D3, CELLIER via D2, and TERRASSE COUVERTE via D1
3. CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE via D2
4. TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE via D1
5. DOUCHE: Connected to CUISINE via D4

Door Connections:
- D1: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
- D2: Connects CUISINE and CELLIER
- D3: Connects CUISINE and CH. PARENTS
- D4: Connects CUISINE and DOUCHE

Navigation Plan:
To go from CH. PARENTS to TERRASSE COUVERTE, we need to:
1. Exit CH. PARENTS into CUISINE
2. From CUISINE, enter TERRASSE COUVERTE

Here's the step-by-step navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CH. PARENTS to TERRASSE COUVERTE using only the necessary doors (D3 and D1) and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
