Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the CUISINE to the DOUCHE.

Rooms and Doors:
1. CUISINE (large central area)
2. TERRASSE COUVERTE (connected to CUISINE)
3. CELLIER (two small rooms connected to CUISINE)
4. CH. PARENTS (bedroom area)
5. DOUCHE (bathroom area)

Doors:
D1: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
D2: Connects CUISINE and CELLIER
D3: Connects CUISINE and CH. PARENTS
D4: Connects CH. PARENTS and DOUCHE

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan to get from CUISINE to DOUCHE:

1. ApproachDoor(3)
2. OpenDoor(3)
3. GoThrough(3)
4. ApproachDoor(4)
5. OpenDoor(4)
6. GoThrough(4)

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the CUISINE to the DOUCHE using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
