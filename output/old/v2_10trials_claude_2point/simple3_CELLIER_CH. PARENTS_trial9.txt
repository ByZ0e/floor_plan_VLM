Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the CELLIER to the CH. PARENTS.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CELLIER connects to CUISINE through D2
2. CUISINE connects to TERRASSE COUVERTE through D1
3. CUISINE connects to CH. PARENTS through D3
4. CH. PARENTS connects to DOUCHE through D4

Now, let's create the navigation plan:

Step 1: Start in CELLIER
Step 2: Use D2 to enter CUISINE
Step 3: Cross CUISINE
Step 4: Use D3 to enter CH. PARENTS

Here's the detailed action plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 2
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 2
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 2
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 3
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the CELLIER to the CH. PARENTS using only the necessary doors (D2 and D3) without any unnecessary detours.
