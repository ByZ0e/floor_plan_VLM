Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms, doors, and connections, then provide a navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CH. PARENTS connects to CUISINE via D3
2. CUISINE connects to CELLIER via D2
3. CELLIER connects to smaller CUISINE area
4. Smaller CUISINE area connects to TERRASSE COUVERTE via D1
5. CH. PARENTS connects to DOUCHE via D4 (not needed for this route)

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
1. Start in CH. PARENTS
2. ApproachDoor(3)
3. OpenDoor(3)
4. GoThrough(3) to enter CUISINE
5. ApproachDoor(2)
6. OpenDoor(2)
7. GoThrough(2) to enter CELLIER
8. Move through CELLIER to the smaller CUISINE area
9. ApproachDoor(1)
10. OpenDoor(1)
11. GoThrough(1) to reach TERRASSE COUVERTE

Final Navigation Plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from CH. PARENTS to TERRASSE COUVERTE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
