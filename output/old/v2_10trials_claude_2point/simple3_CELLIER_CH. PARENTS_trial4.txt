Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms, doors, and their connections, then provide a detailed navigation plan for you to move from the CELLIER to the CH. PARENTS.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

Rooms:
1. CELLIER (two instances)
2. CUISINE (multiple instances, appears to be one large space)
3. TERRASSE COUVERTE
4. CH. PARENTS
5. DOUCHE

Doors and their connections:
D1: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE to CUISINE
D2: Connects CELLIER to CUISINE
D3: Connects CUISINE to CH. PARENTS
D4: Connects CUISINE to DOUCHE

Now, I'll provide the step-by-step navigation plan from CELLIER to CH. PARENTS:

1. ApproachDoor(2)
2. OpenDoor(2)
3. GoThrough(2)
4. ApproachDoor(3)
5. OpenDoor(3)
6. GoThrough(3)

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently guide you from the CELLIER to the CH. PARENTS using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
