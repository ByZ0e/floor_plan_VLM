Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms, doors, and their connections, then provide a navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
- TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE via D1
- CUISINE (large central area): Connected to TERRASSE COUVERTE via D1, to CELLIER via D2, and to CH. PARENTS via D3
- CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE via D2
- CH. PARENTS: Connected to CUISINE via D3, and to DOUCHE via D4
- DOUCHE: Connected to CH. PARENTS via D4

Now, I'll provide the step-by-step navigation plan to go from TERRASSE COUVERTE to CUISINE:

1. Start in TERRASSE COUVERTE
2. ApproachDoor(1)
3. OpenDoor(1)
4. GoThrough(1)

This sequence will take you directly from TERRASSE COUVERTE to CUISINE, which is your destination.

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "TERRASSE COUVERTE",
  "end": "CUISINE",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from TERRASSE COUVERTE to CUISINE using only the necessary door (D1) and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
