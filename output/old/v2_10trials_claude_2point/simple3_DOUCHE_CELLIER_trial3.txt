Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the DOUCHE to the CELLIER.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects TERRASSE COUVERTE and CUISINE
2. D2 connects CUISINE and CELLIER
3. D3 connects CUISINE and CH. PARENTS
4. D4 connects CUISINE and DOUCHE

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in DOUCHE
2. Use D4 to enter CUISINE
3. Use D2 to enter CELLIER

Now, I'll provide the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 2
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 2
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 2
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the DOUCHE to the CELLIER using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
