Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. Let me analyze the layout and provide you with the necessary information and navigation plan.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

Rooms:
- DOUCHE (Bathroom)
- CH. PARENTS (Parents' Bedroom)
- CUISINE (Kitchen)
- CELLIER (Cellar)
- TERRASSE COUVERTE (Covered Terrace)

Doors:
D1: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE to CUISINE
D2: Connects CUISINE to CELLIER
D3: Connects CUISINE to CH. PARENTS
D4: Connects CUISINE to DOUCHE

Now, let's create the navigation plan to go from DOUCHE to CELLIER:

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in DOUCHE
2. Use D4 to enter CUISINE
3. From CUISINE, use D2 to reach CELLIER

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 2
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 2
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 2
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from DOUCHE to CELLIER, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
