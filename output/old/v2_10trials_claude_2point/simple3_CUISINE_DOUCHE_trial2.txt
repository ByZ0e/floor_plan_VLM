Thank you for providing the floor plan image. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the CUISINE to the DOUCHE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CUISINE connects to TERRASSE COUVERTE via D1
2. CUISINE connects to CELLIER via D2
3. CUISINE connects to CH. PARENTS via D3
4. CH. PARENTS connects to DOUCHE via D4

Navigation Plan:
To navigate from CUISINE to DOUCHE, we need to go through the following steps:

1. ApproachDoor(3)
2. OpenDoor(3)
3. GoThrough(3)
4. ApproachDoor(4)
5. OpenDoor(4)
6. GoThrough(4)

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the CUISINE to the DOUCHE using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
