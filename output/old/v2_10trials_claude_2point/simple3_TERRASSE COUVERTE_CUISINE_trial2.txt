Thank you for providing the floor plan. Let me analyze the rooms and doors, and then provide you with a navigation plan.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

1. TERRASSE COUVERTE connects to CUISINE via D1
2. CUISINE (large central area) connects to:
   - TERRASSE COUVERTE via D1
   - CELLIER via D2
   - CH. PARENTS via D3
   - DOUCHE via D4

Now, let's create the navigation plan to go from TERRASSE COUVERTE to CUISINE:

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in TERRASSE COUVERTE
2. Approach D1
3. Open D1
4. Go through D1 to enter CUISINE

The plan is straightforward as the TERRASSE COUVERTE is directly connected to the CUISINE via D1.

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to the CUISINE using the most direct path available.
