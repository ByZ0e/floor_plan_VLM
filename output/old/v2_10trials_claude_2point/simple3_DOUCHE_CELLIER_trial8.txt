Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan for you to move from the DOUCHE to the CELLIER.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE and CUISINE
2. D2: Connects CUISINE and CELLIER
3. D3: Connects CUISINE and CH. PARENTS
4. D4: Connects CUISINE and DOUCHE

Step-by-step navigation plan:

1. Start in DOUCHE
2. ApproachDoor(D4)
3. OpenDoor(D4)
4. GoThrough(D4) to enter CUISINE
5. ApproachDoor(D2)
6. OpenDoor(D2)
7. GoThrough(D2) to enter CELLIER

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "DOUCHE",
  "end": "CELLIER",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the DOUCHE to the CELLIER, using only the necessary doors (D4 and D2) and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
