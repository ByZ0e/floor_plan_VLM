Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the connections and provide a navigation plan as requested.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
D2: Connects CUISINE to CELLIER
D3: Connects CUISINE to CH. PARENTS
D4: Connects CUISINE to DOUCHE

Navigation Plan:

Starting from CELLIER, we need to reach CH. PARENTS. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(D2)
2. OpenDoor(D2)
3. GoThrough(D2)
4. ApproachDoor(D3)
5. OpenDoor(D3)
6. GoThrough(D3)

This plan takes you from CELLIER to CUISINE, and then from CUISINE to CH. PARENTS, using the most direct route available.

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"}
  ]
}
```

This plan ensures you navigate efficiently from the starting point (CELLIER) to the destination (CH. PARENTS) using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
