Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from CH. PARENTS to TERRASSE COUVERTE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CH. PARENTS connects to CUISINE via D3
2. CUISINE connects to CELLIER via D2
3. CUISINE connects to TERRASSE COUVERTE via D1
4. DOUCHE connects to CUISINE via D4

Navigation Plan:
To get from CH. PARENTS to TERRASSE COUVERTE, we need to go through the CUISINE. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(3)
2. OpenDoor(3)
3. GoThrough(3)
4. ApproachDoor(1)
5. OpenDoor(1)
6. GoThrough(1)

Here's the plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "doorNumber": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "doorNumber": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "doorNumber": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "doorNumber": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "doorNumber": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "doorNumber": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CH. PARENTS to TERRASSE COUVERTE using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
