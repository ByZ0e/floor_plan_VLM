Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the CUISINE to the DOUCHE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
2. D2 connects CUISINE and CELLIER
3. D3 connects CUISINE and CH. PARENTS
4. D4 connects CUISINE and DOUCHE

Now, let's create the navigation plan to go from CUISINE to DOUCHE:

1. ApproachDoor(4)
2. OpenDoor(4)
3. GoThrough(4)

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from the CUISINE to the DOUCHE. It uses only the necessary door (D4) to reach the destination without traversing any unnecessary rooms or doors.
