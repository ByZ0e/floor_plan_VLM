Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. Let me first list out the rooms and doors with their connections based on the image:

Room and Door Connections:
1. TERRASSE COUVERTE <-> D1 <-> CUISINE
2. CUISINE <-> D2 <-> CELLIER
3. CUISINE <-> D3 <-> CH. PARENTS
4. CUISINE <-> D4 <-> DOUCHE

For the navigation task from TERRASSE COUVERTE to CUISINE, we only need to use one door: D1. Here's the step-by-step navigation plan:

1. Start in TERRASSE COUVERTE
2. Approach D1
3. Open D1
4. Go through D1 to enter CUISINE

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from TERRASSE COUVERTE to CUISINE using only the necessary door (D1) and avoids any unnecessary steps or rooms.
