Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the DOUCHE to the CELLIER.

Room and Door Connections:
1. DOUCHE connects to CUISINE through D4
2. CUISINE connects to CH. PARENTS through D3
3. CUISINE connects to TERRASSE COUVERTE through D1
4. CUISINE connects to CELLIER through D2

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
1. Start in DOUCHE
2. ApproachDoor(D4)
3. OpenDoor(D4)
4. GoThrough(D4) to enter CUISINE
5. ApproachDoor(D2)
6. OpenDoor(D2)
7. GoThrough(D2) to reach CELLIER

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the DOUCHE to the CELLIER, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
