Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CH. PARENTS connects to CUISINE via D3
2. CUISINE connects to CELLIER via D2
3. CELLIER connects to smaller CUISINE area
4. Smaller CUISINE area connects to TERRASSE COUVERTE via D1
5. CH. PARENTS connects to DOUCHE via D4

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
1. Start in CH. PARENTS
2. Approach and go through D3 to enter CUISINE
3. Cross CUISINE to reach D2
4. Go through D2 to enter CELLIER
5. Cross CELLIER and smaller CUISINE area to reach D1
6. Go through D1 to arrive at TERRASSE COUVERTE

Now, I'll provide the detailed action sequence in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CH. PARENTS to TERRASSE COUVERTE using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
