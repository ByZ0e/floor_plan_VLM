Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms, doors, and connections, then provide a navigation plan as requested.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

Rooms:
1. CELLIER (two connected spaces)
2. CUISINE (multiple connected spaces)
3. TERRASSE COUVERTE
4. CH. PARENTS
5. DOUCHE

Doors and their connections:
D1: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
D2: Connects CELLIER to CUISINE
D3: Connects CUISINE to CH. PARENTS
D4: Connects CUISINE to DOUCHE

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan to go from CELLIER to CH. PARENTS:

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CELLIER
2. Use D2 to enter CUISINE
3. Move through CUISINE
4. Use D3 to enter CH. PARENTS

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from CELLIER to CH. PARENTS using only the necessary doors (D2 and D3) and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
