Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms, doors, and their connections, then provide a navigation plan as requested.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

Rooms:
1. CELLIER (two instances)
2. CUISINE (multiple instances, forming a large central area)
3. TERRASSE COUVERTE
4. CH. PARENTS
5. DOUCHE

Doors:
D1: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE and CUISINE
D2: Connects CELLIER and CUISINE
D3: Connects CUISINE and CH. PARENTS
D4: Connects CUISINE and DOUCHE

Now, I'll create a step-by-step navigation plan from CELLIER to CH. PARENTS:

1. ApproachDoor(D2)
2. OpenDoor(D2)
3. GoThrough(D2)
4. ApproachDoor(D3)
5. OpenDoor(D3)
6. GoThrough(D3)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan will efficiently guide you from the CELLIER to CH. PARENTS using only the necessary doors and actions.
