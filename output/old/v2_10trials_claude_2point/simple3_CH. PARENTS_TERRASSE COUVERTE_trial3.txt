Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a detailed navigation plan for you to move from CH. PARENTS to TERRASSE COUVERTE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
2. D2: Connects CUISINE to CELLIER
3. D3: Connects CUISINE to CH. PARENTS
4. D4: Connects CUISINE to DOUCHE

Navigation Plan:

To get from CH. PARENTS to TERRASSE COUVERTE, you need to go through the CUISINE. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. Start in CH. PARENTS
2. Use D3 to enter CUISINE
3. Cross CUISINE
4. Use D1 to reach TERRASSE COUVERTE

Now, I'll provide the detailed action sequence in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently guide you from CH. PARENTS to TERRASSE COUVERTE using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
