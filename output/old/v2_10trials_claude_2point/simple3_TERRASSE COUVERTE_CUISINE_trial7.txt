Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to the CUISINE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects TERRASSE COUVERTE to CUISINE
2. D2 connects CUISINE to CELLIER
3. D3 connects CUISINE to CH. PARENTS
4. D4 connects CUISINE to DOUCHE

Navigation Plan:
To move from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to the CUISINE, we only need to use one door: D1. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(1)
2. OpenDoor(1)
3. GoThrough(1)

This sequence will take you directly from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to the CUISINE, which is your destination.

Here's the plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan is the most efficient route from the starting point to the destination, using only the necessary door (D1) to enter the CUISINE from the TERRASSE COUVERTE.
