Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the DOUCHE to the CELLIER.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

Rooms:
1. DOUCHE
2. CH. PARENTS
3. CUISINE (multiple areas labeled as CUISINE)
4. CELLIER
5. TERRASSE COUVERTE

Doors and their connections:
D1: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE and CUISINE
D2: Connects CUISINE and CELLIER
D3: Connects CUISINE and CH. PARENTS
D4: Connects CUISINE and DOUCHE

Now, let's create the navigation plan from DOUCHE to CELLIER:

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in DOUCHE
2. Use D4 to enter CUISINE
3. Cross CUISINE
4. Use D2 to enter CELLIER

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D2"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D2"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D2"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the DOUCHE to the CELLIER, using only the necessary doors (D4 and D2) and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
