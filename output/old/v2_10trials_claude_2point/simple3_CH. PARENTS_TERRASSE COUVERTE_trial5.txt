Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from CH. PARENTS to TERRASSE COUVERTE.

Rooms and Doors:
1. CH. PARENTS: Connected to CUISINE via D3
2. CUISINE: Connected to CH. PARENTS via D3, to CELLIER via D2, and to TERRASSE COUVERTE via D1
3. CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE via D2
4. TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE via D1
5. DOUCHE: Not directly relevant to this path

Door Connections:
- D1: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
- D2: Connects CUISINE and CELLIER
- D3: Connects CUISINE and CH. PARENTS
- D4: Connects CUISINE and DOUCHE (not needed for this path)

Navigation Plan:
1. Start in CH. PARENTS
2. ApproachDoor(3)
3. OpenDoor(3)
4. GoThrough(3) // Now in CUISINE
5. ApproachDoor(1)
6. OpenDoor(1)
7. GoThrough(1) // Now in TERRASSE COUVERTE

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(3)",
    "OpenDoor(3)",
    "GoThrough(3)",
    "ApproachDoor(1)",
    "OpenDoor(1)",
    "GoThrough(1)"
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CH. PARENTS to TERRASSE COUVERTE using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
