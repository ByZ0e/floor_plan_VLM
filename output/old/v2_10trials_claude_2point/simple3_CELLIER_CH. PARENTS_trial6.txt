Thank you for providing the floor plan image. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the CELLIER to CH. PARENTS.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

1. D1 connects TERRASSE COUVERTE to CUISINE
2. D2 connects CELLIER to CUISINE
3. D3 connects CUISINE to CH. PARENTS
4. D4 connects CUISINE to DOUCHE

Navigation Plan:

To navigate from CELLIER to CH. PARENTS, we need to use doors D2 and D3. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(2)
2. OpenDoor(2)
3. GoThrough(2)
4. ApproachDoor(3)
5. OpenDoor(3)
6. GoThrough(3)

Now, I'll provide the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CELLIER",
  "end": "CH. PARENTS",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan will efficiently guide you from the CELLIER to CH. PARENTS using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
