I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections based on the floor plan:

Rooms and their connections:
1. TERRASSE COUVERTE - connects to CUISINE via D1
2. CUISINE - large central room, connects to TERRASSE COUVERTE (D1), CELLIER (D2), CH. PARENTS (D3), and DOUCHE (D4)
3. CELLIER - connects to CUISINE via D2
4. CH. PARENTS - connects to CUISINE via D3
5. DOUCHE - connects to CUISINE via D4

Doors:
D1: Between TERRASSE COUVERTE and CUISINE
D2: Between CUISINE and CELLIER
D3: Between CUISINE and CH. PARENTS
D4: Between CUISINE and DOUCHE

Now, for the navigation plan from TERRASSE COUVERTE to CUISINE:

The path is straightforward as the TERRASSE COUVERTE is directly connected to the CUISINE via door D1. Here's the efficient navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "target": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "target": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "target": "D1"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to the CUISINE using the only necessary door, D1.
