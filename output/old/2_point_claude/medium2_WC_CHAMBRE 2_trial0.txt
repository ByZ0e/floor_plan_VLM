Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout and provide you with an efficient navigation plan from the WC to CHAMBRE 2. First, let me list out the rooms and doors with their connections:

Rooms and their connections:
- WC: Connected to HALL via D3
- HALL: Central area connecting multiple rooms
- CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL via D6

Doors and their connections:
- D3: Connects WC to HALL
- D6: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 2

Now, let's create the navigation plan:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently guide you from the WC to CHAMBRE 2 using only the necessary doors. The path avoids any unnecessary rooms or doors, and follows the most direct route based on the floor plan provided.
