First, let me describe the rooms and doors as shown in the floor plan:

Rooms:
- GARAGE
- CELLIER (3 connected spaces)
- CHAMBRE 1
- BAINS
- WC
- CHAMBRE 2
- CHAMBRE 3
- HALL (multiple connected spaces)
- Porche

Doors:
D1: Between GARAGE and CELLIER
D2: Between CHAMBRE 1 and HALL
D3: Between WC and HALL
D4: Between BAINS and HALL
D5: Between CHAMBRE 3 and HALL
D6: Between CHAMBRE 2 and HALL
D7: Between CELLIER and HALL
D8: Between HALL and Porche

Now, for the navigation plan from CELLIER to CHAMBRE 3:

The most efficient path is:

1. Start in CELLIER
2. Use D7 to enter HALL
3. Use D5 to enter CHAMBRE 3

Here's the plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct route from CELLIER to CHAMBRE 3, using only the necessary doors (D7 and D5) and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
