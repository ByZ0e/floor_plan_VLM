Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing out the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide the navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
- CUISINE: Connected to SEJOUR via D5
- SEJOUR: Connected to CUISINE via D5, to CH.1 via D4, to CH.2 via D3, and to CH.3 via D2
- CH.1: Connected to SEJOUR via D4
- CH.2: Connected to SEJOUR via D3
- CH.3: Connected to SEJOUR via D2 and to another CH.3 via D1

Now, for the navigation plan from CUISINE to CH.3:

1. ApproachDoor(D5)
2. OpenDoor(D5)
3. GoThrough(D5)
4. ApproachDoor(D2)
5. OpenDoor(D2)
6. GoThrough(D2)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the CUISINE to CH.3 using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
