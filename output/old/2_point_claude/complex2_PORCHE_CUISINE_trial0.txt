Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing out the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the PORCHE to the CUISINE.

Room and Door Connections:
- PORCHE: Connected to HALL via D5
- HALL: Connected to CHAMBRE 2 via D2, BAINS via D3, WC via D4, CHAMBRE 1 via D6, CUISINE via D7
- CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D7, TERRASSE COUVERTE via D8
- GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER via D9
- CELLIER: Connected to GARAGE via D9, another CELLIER via D1

Navigation Plan:
To go from the PORCHE to the CUISINE, we need to use the following path:
PORCHE -> D5 -> HALL -> D7 -> CUISINE

Here's the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D5"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D5"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D5"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D7"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D7"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D7"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the PORCHE to the CUISINE using only the necessary doors along the path.
