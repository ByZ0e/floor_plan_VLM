Thank you for providing the floor plan. Let me first describe the rooms and doors for clarity:

Rooms:
1. CUISINE (multiple areas labeled as CUISINE)
2. CELLIER
3. TERRASSE COUVERTE
4. CH. PARENTS
5. DOUCHE

Doors:
D1: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
D2: Connects CUISINE to CELLIER
D3: Connects CUISINE to CH. PARENTS
D4: Connects CH. PARENTS to DOUCHE

Now, for the navigation plan from CUISINE to DOUCHE:

The most efficient path is to go through the CUISINE, then through CH. PARENTS, and finally to DOUCHE. We'll need to use doors D3 and D4.

Here's the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "target": "D3"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "target": "D3"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "target": "D3"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "target": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "target": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "target": "D4"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently guide you from the CUISINE to the DOUCHE using only the necessary doors along the path.
