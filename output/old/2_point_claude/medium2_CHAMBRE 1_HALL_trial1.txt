Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan as requested.

Rooms and Doors:
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to GARAGE via D1, to HALL via D2
- GARAGE: Connected to CHAMBRE 1 via D1
- HALL: Connected to CHAMBRE 1 via D2, to BAINS/WC area via D3, to CHAMBRE 3 via D4, to CHAMBRE 2 via D5 and D6, to CELLIER area via D7, to Porche via D8

Based on this layout, here's the efficient navigation plan to go from CHAMBRE 1 to HALL:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"}
  ]
}
```

This plan is the most direct and efficient route from CHAMBRE 1 to HALL. It only requires using one door (D2) which directly connects these two areas. No unnecessary doors or rooms are included in this path.
