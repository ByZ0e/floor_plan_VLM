Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan.

Rooms and Doors:
- CH.1: Connected to HALL via D2
- CH.2: Connected to HALL via D3
- BAINS (Bathroom): Connected to HALL via D1
- GARAGE: Connected to CUISINE via D4
- CUISINE (Kitchen): Connected to GARAGE via D4, connected to HALL via D5
- HALL: Central area connecting multiple rooms

Navigation Plan:
To go from CH.1 to GARAGE, we need to pass through the HALL and CUISINE. Here's the detailed plan:

{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
  ]
}

This plan efficiently navigates from CH.1 to the GARAGE using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours. The robot will exit CH.1 through D2, move through the HALL, enter the CUISINE through D5, and finally enter the GARAGE through D4.
