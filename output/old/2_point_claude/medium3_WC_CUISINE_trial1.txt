Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide the navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
- WC: Connected to Hall via D4
- Hall: Connected to WC (D4), Douche (D2), Chambre 1 (D5), Cuisine (D6)
- Douche: Connected to Hall via D2
- Chambre 1: Connected to Hall via D5
- Cuisine: Connected to Hall via D6, connected to Cellier via D7
- Cellier: Connected to Cuisine via D7, connected to Garages via D1
- Garages: Connected to Cellier via D1

Now, for the navigation plan from WC to Cuisine:

{
  "plan": [
    "ApproachDoor(D4)",
    "OpenDoor(D4)",
    "GoThrough(D4)",
    "ApproachDoor(D6)",
    "OpenDoor(D6)",
    "GoThrough(D6)"
  ]
}

This plan efficiently navigates from the WC to the Cuisine using only the necessary doors. It avoids any unnecessary rooms or doors, providing a direct path through the Hall to reach the Cuisine.
