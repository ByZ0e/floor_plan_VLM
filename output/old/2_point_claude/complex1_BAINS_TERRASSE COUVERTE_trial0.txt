First, let me list out the rooms and doors with their connections based on the floor plan:

Rooms and their connections:
- BAINS: Connected to HALL via D2
- WC: Connected to HALL via D3
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D4
- CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL via D5
- CELLIER: Connected to HALL via D1
- GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER via D9
- CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D7
- PORCHE: Connected to HALL via D6
- TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE via D8

Doors:
D1: Connects CELLIER and HALL

D3: Connects WC and HALL
D4: Connects CHAMBRE 1 and HALL
D5: Connects CHAMBRE 2 and HALL
D6: Connects PORCHE and HALL
D7: Connects CUISINE and HALL
D8: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Connects CELLIER and GARAGE

Now, for the navigation plan from BAINS to TERRASSE COUVERTE:

{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(D2)",
    "OpenDoor(D2)",
    "GoThrough(D2)",
    "ApproachDoor(D7)",
    "OpenDoor(D7)",
    "GoThrough(D7)",
    "ApproachDoor(D8)",
    "OpenDoor(D8)",
    "GoThrough(D8)"
  ]
}

This path takes you from BAINS through the HALL, into the CUISINE, and finally to the TERRASSE COUVERTE. It's the most direct and efficient route based on the floor plan provided.
