Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing out the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide the navigation plan as requested.

Rooms and Doors:
- PORCHE: Connected to HALL via D5
- HALL: Central area connecting multiple rooms
- CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D7
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D6
- CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL via D2
- BAINS: Connected to HALL via D3
- WC: Connected to HALL via D4
- CELLIER: Connected to GARAGE via D9, and to HALL via D1
- GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER via D9
- TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE via D8

Now, for the navigation plan from PORCHE to CUISINE:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"}
  ]
}
```

This path takes you from the PORCHE to the CUISINE in the most efficient manner, using only the necessary doors. You'll start in the PORCHE, go through D5 to enter the HALL, and then use D7 to enter the CUISINE, which is your final destination.
