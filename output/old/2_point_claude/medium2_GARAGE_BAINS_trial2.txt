Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide you with an efficient navigation plan from the GARAGE to the BAINS.

Rooms and Doors:
- GARAGE: Connected to CHAMBRE 1 via D1
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to GARAGE via D1, to HALL via D2
- CELLIER: Three separate cellier spaces, connected to HALL via D7
- HALL: Central area connecting multiple rooms
- CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL via D6
- CHAMBRE 3: Connected to HALL via D5
- BAINS: Connected to HALL via D4
- WC: Connected to HALL via D3
- Porche: Connected to HALL via D8

Now, let's create the navigation plan from GARAGE to BAINS:

{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(D1)",
    "OpenDoor(D1)",
    "GoThrough(D1)",
    "ApproachDoor(D2)",
    "OpenDoor(D2)",
    "GoThrough(D2)",
    "ApproachDoor(D4)",
    "OpenDoor(D4)",
    "GoThrough(D4)"
  ]
}

This plan will efficiently guide you from the GARAGE to the BAINS using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
