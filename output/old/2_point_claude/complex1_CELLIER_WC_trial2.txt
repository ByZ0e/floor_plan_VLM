Certainly! I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan in JSON format.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CELLIER: Connected to HALL via D1
2. GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER via D9
3. HALL: Central area connecting multiple rooms
4. BAINS: Connected to HALL
5. WC: Connected to HALL via D2
6. CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL via D5
7. CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D4
8. CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D7
9. PORCHE: Connected to HALL via D6
10. TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE via D8

Navigation Plan:
To go from CELLIER to WC, we need to use two doors: D1 and D2. Here's the efficient navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CELLIER",
  "end": "WC",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the CELLIER to the WC using only the necessary doors (D1 and D2) and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
