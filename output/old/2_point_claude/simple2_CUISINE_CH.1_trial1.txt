Certainly! I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan in JSON format.

Rooms and Doors:
- CUISINE: Connected to GARAGE via D4, connected to HALL via D5
- GARAGE: Connected to CUISINE via D4
- HALL: Central area connecting multiple rooms
- CH.2: Connected to HALL via D3
- CH.1: Connected to HALL via D2
- BAINS: Connected to HALL via D1

Navigation Plan:
To go from CUISINE to CH.1, we need to follow this path: CUISINE -> D5 -> HALL -> D2 -> CH.1

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D5"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D5"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D5"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D2"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D2"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D2"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from the CUISINE to CH.1, using only the necessary doors (D5 and D2) and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
