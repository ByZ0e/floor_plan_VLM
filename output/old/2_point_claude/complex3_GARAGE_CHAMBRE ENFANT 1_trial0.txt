Before providing the navigation plan, let me describe the rooms and doors as seen in the floor plan:

Rooms:
- GARAGE (starting point)
- PORCHE
- CELLIER (multiple areas)
- HALL (multiple areas)
- LINGERIE
- WC
- BUREAU
- BAINS
- CHAMBRE PARENTS
- CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 (destination)
- CHAMBRE ENFANT 2

Doors:
D1: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER
D2: Connects CELLIER to PORCHE
D3: Connects PORCHE to HALL
D4: Connects HALL to WC
D5: Connects HALL to LINGERIE
D6: Connects HALL to BUREAU
D7: Connects HALL to BAINS
D8: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE PARENTS
D9: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
D10: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
D11: Connects CELLIER to HALL

Now, for the navigation plan from GARAGE to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D10"}
  ]
}
```

This path takes you from the GARAGE, through the CELLIER, into the HALL, and finally into CHAMBRE ENFANT 1, using only the necessary doors along the way.
