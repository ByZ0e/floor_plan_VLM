Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan.

Rooms and Doors:
- WC: Connected to HALL via D3
- HALL: Central area connecting multiple rooms
- CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL via D6
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D2
- GARAGE: Connected to HALL via D1
- CELLIER: Connected to HALL via D7
- BAINS: Connected to HALL via D4
- CHAMBRE 3: Connected to HALL via D5
- Porche: Connected to HALL via D8

Navigation Plan:
To go from WC to CHAMBRE 2, we need to use two doors: D3 and D6.

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the WC to CHAMBRE 2 using only the necessary doors.
