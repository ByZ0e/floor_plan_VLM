Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing out the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide the navigation plan.

Rooms and Doors:
- DOUCHE: Connected to CUISINE via D4
- CUISINE: Large central area, connected to DOUCHE via D4, CH. PARENTS, TERRASSE COUVERTE via D1, and CELLIER via D2
- CH. PARENTS: Connected to CUISINE
- TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE via D1
- CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE via D2

Navigation Plan:
To go from DOUCHE to CELLIER, we need to pass through the CUISINE. Here's the detailed plan:

{
  "plan": [
    "ApproachDoor(D4)",
    "OpenDoor(D4)",
    "GoThrough(D4)",
    "ApproachDoor(D2)",
    "OpenDoor(D2)",
    "GoThrough(D2)"
  ]
}

This plan will efficiently take you from the DOUCHE to the CELLIER using only the necessary doors. You'll start by exiting the DOUCHE through D4 into the CUISINE, then cross the CUISINE to reach D2, which leads to the CELLIER.
