Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing out the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide you with the navigation plan.

Rooms and Doors:
- GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER via D9
- CELLIER: Connected to HALL via D1
- HALL: Central area connecting multiple rooms
- BAINS: Connected to HALL via D2
- WC: Connected to HALL via D3
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D4
- CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL via D5
- PORCHE: Connected to HALL via D6
- CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D7
- TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE via D8

Now, for the navigation plan from GARAGE to CHAMBRE 2:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from the GARAGE to CHAMBRE 2, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours. The robot will start in the GARAGE, go through the CELLIER, enter the central HALL area, and then directly access CHAMBRE 2.
