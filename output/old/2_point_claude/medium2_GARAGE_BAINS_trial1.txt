Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide the navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
- GARAGE: Connected to CHAMBRE 1 via D1
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to GARAGE via D1, to HALL via D2
- CELLIER: Connected to HALL via D7
- HALL: Connected to CHAMBRE 1 via D2, to CELLIER via D7, to Porche via D8, to WC via D3, to CHAMBRE 3 via D4, to CHAMBRE 2 via D5 and D6
- WC: Connected to HALL via D3
- BAINS: Connected to HALL via D4
- CHAMBRE 3: Connected to HALL via D4
- CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL via D5 and D6
- Porche: Connected to HALL via D8

Navigation Plan:
To get from the GARAGE to BAINS, we need to go through CHAMBRE 1 and the HALL. Here's the efficient navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the GARAGE to BAINS using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
