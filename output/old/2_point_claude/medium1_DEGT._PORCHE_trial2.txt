I'll start by listing out the rooms and doors with their connections based on the floor plan:

Rooms and their connections:
- DEGT: Connected to CH.1, CH.2, SEJOUR, and BAINS via D4, D5, D6, D7
- SEJOUR: Connected to CUISINE via D3, to DEGT via D4, and to outside (PORCHE) via D1
- CUISINE: Connected to SEJOUR via D3, to CELLIER via D2
- CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE via D2
- CH.1: Connected to DEGT via D5
- CH.2: Connected to DEGT via D6
- BAINS: Connected to DEGT via D7
- WC: Connected to BAINS via D8

Now, for the navigation plan from DEGT to PORCHE:

The most efficient path would be:
DEGT -> D4 -> SEJOUR -> D1 -> PORCHE

Here's the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D1"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the starting point in DEGT to the final destination PORCHE, using only the necessary doors (D4 and D1) and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
