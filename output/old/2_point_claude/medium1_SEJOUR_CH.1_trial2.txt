I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections based on the floor plan:

Rooms and their connections:
- SEJOUR: Connected to CUISINE via D1 and D3, to DEGT via D4
- CUISINE: Connected to SEJOUR via D1 and D3, to CELLIER via D2
- CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE via D2
- DEGT: Connected to SEJOUR via D4, to CH.1 via D5, to CH.2 via D6, to BAINS via D7
- CH.1: Connected to DEGT via D5
- CH.2: Connected to DEGT via D6
- BAINS: Connected to DEGT via D7, to WC via D8
- WC: Connected to BAINS via D8

Now, for the navigation plan from SEJOUR to CH.1:

The most efficient path is:
1. From SEJOUR, go through D4 to enter DEGT
2. From DEGT, go through D5 to enter CH.1

Here's the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D5"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D5"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D5"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from SEJOUR to CH.1, using only the necessary doors (D4 and D5) and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
