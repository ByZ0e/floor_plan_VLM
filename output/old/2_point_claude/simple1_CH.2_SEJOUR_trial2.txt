Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing out the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide you with the navigation plan.

Rooms and Doors:
- CH.3: connected to SEJOUR via D1 and D2
- CH.2: connected to CH.3 via D2, and to SEJOUR via D3
- CH.1: connected to SEJOUR via D4
- SEJOUR: central area connected to all other rooms
- CUISINE: connected to SEJOUR via D5 and D6

Now, for the navigation plan from CH.2 to SEJOUR:

The most efficient path is to use door D3, which directly connects CH.2 to SEJOUR. Here's the detailed plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CH.2",
  "destination": "SEJOUR",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently guide you from CH.2 to SEJOUR using the most direct route available.
