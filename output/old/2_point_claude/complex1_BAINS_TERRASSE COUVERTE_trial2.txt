Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors, and then provide a navigation plan from BAINS to TERRASSE COUVERTE.

Rooms and their connections:
1. CELLIER: Connected to HALL via D1
2. GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER via D9
3. BAINS: Connected to HALL via D2
4. WC: Connected to HALL via D3
5. CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL via D5
6. CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D4
7. CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D7
8. PORCHE: Connected to HALL via D6
9. TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE via D8

Doors:
D1: Connects CELLIER and HALL
D2: Connects BAINS and HALL
D3: Connects WC and HALL
D4: Connects CHAMBRE 1 and HALL
D5: Connects CHAMBRE 2 and HALL
D6: Connects PORCHE and HALL
D7: Connects CUISINE and HALL
D8: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Connects CELLIER and GARAGE

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan from BAINS to TERRASSE COUVERTE:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from BAINS to TERRASSE COUVERTE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
