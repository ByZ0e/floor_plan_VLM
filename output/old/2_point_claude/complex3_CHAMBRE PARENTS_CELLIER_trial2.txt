  "destination": "CELLIER",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan provides the most efficient path from CHAMBRE PARENTS to CELLIER, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
