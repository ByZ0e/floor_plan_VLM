Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide the navigation plan.

Rooms and Doors:
- DOUCHE: Connected to HALL via D2
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D5
- WC: Connected to HALL via D4
- CELLIER: Connected to GARAGES via D1, connected to CUISINE via D3
- CUISINE: Connected to CELLIER via D3, connected to HALL via D6
- GARAGES: Connected to CELLIER via D1
- HALL: Central area connecting multiple rooms

Now, for the navigation plan from DOUCHE to CHAMBRE 1:

{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"}
  ]
}

This plan takes you from the DOUCHE, through the HALL, and into CHAMBRE 1 using the most direct route available. It avoids unnecessary doors and rooms, ensuring an efficient path to your destination.
