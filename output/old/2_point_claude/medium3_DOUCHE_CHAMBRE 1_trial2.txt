Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide you with an efficient navigation plan from the DOUCHE to CHAMBRE 1.

Room and Door Connections:
- DOUCHE: Connected to HALL via D2
- WC: Connected to HALL via D4
- CELLIER: Connected to GARAGES via D1, to CUISINE via D3
- CUISINE: Connected to CELLIER via D3, to HALL via D6
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D5
- GARAGES: Connected to CELLIER via D1
- HALL: Central area connecting multiple rooms (D2, D4, D5, D6, D7)

Now, let's create the navigation plan from DOUCHE to CHAMBRE 1:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently guides you from the DOUCHE to CHAMBRE 1 using only the necessary doors. You'll start by exiting the DOUCHE through D2 into the HALL, then approach and go through D5 to enter CHAMBRE 1. This is the most direct route available based on the floor plan provided.
