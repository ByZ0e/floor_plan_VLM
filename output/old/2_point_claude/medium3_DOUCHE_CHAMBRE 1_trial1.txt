Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide you with a navigation plan from the DOUCHE to CHAMBRE 1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. DOUCHE: Connected to HALL via D2
2. WC: Connected to HALL via D4
3. CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D5
4. CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D6 and D7
5. CELLIER: Connected to GARAGES via D1 and to CUISINE via D3
6. GARAGES: Connected to CELLIER via D1

Now, for the navigation plan from DOUCHE to CHAMBRE 1:

{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(D2)",
    "OpenDoor(D2)",
    "GoThrough(D2)",
    "ApproachDoor(D5)",
    "OpenDoor(D5)",
    "GoThrough(D5)"
  ]
}

This plan will efficiently guide you from the DOUCHE to CHAMBRE 1 using only the necessary doors. You'll exit the DOUCHE through D2 into the HALL, then enter CHAMBRE 1 through D5.
