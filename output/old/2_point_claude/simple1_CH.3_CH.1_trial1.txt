Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan.

Rooms and Doors:
- CH.3: Connected to SEJOUR via D1 and D2
- CH.2: Connected to SEJOUR via D3
- CH.1: Connected to SEJOUR via D4
- SEJOUR: Large central area connected to all rooms and CUISINE
- CUISINE: Connected to SEJOUR via D5 and D6

Now, for the navigation plan from CH.3 to CH.1:

The most efficient path from CH.3 to CH.1 is through the SEJOUR. Here's the detailed plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D2"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D2"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D2"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D4"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan takes you from CH.3 through the SEJOUR and directly into CH.1, using only the necessary doors (D2 and D4) to complete the task efficiently.
