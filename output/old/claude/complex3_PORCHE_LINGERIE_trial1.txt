Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the PORCHE to the LINGERIE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. PORCHE connects to CELLIER via D2
2. CELLIER connects to HALL via D3
3. HALL connects to WC via D4
4. HALL connects to LINGERIE via D5
5. LINGERIE connects to BUREAU via D6
6. BUREAU connects to BAINS via D7
7. BAINS connects to HALL via D8
8. HALL connects to CHAMBRE PARENTS via D9
9. HALL connects to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 via D10
10. CELLIER connects to GARAGE via D1 and D11

Navigation Plan:
To go from the PORCHE to the LINGERIE, we need to use the following sequence of actions:

```json
{
  "actions": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the PORCHE to the LINGERIE using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
