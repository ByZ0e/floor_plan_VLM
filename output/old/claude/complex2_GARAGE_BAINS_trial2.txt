Certainly! Let's start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections based on the floor plan image:

Rooms and Door Connections:
1. Garage - connected to Cellier via D9
2. Cellier - connected to Garage via D9, connected to Hall via D1
3. Chambre 2 - connected to Hall via D2
4. Porche - connected to Hall via D5
5. Cuisine - connected to Hall via D7, connected to Terrasse Couverte via D8
6. Chambre 1 - connected to Hall via D6
7. WC - connected to Hall via D4
8. Bains - connected to Hall via D3
9. Hall - central area connecting multiple rooms

Now, let's create the navigation plan to go from the Garage to the Bains:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan takes you from the Garage to the Bains in the most efficient way possible, using only the necessary doors. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. Start in the Garage
2. Approach and go through door D9 to enter the Cellier
3. From the Cellier, approach and go through door D1 to enter the Hall
4. In the Hall, approach and go through door D3 to reach the Bains

This path avoids any unnecessary rooms or doors, providing a direct route to the destination.
