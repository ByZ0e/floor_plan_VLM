Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms, doors, and connections, then provide a navigation plan for you to move from CH.2 to SEJOUR.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CH.2 connects to SEJOUR through D3
2. SEJOUR is a large central area connecting multiple rooms
3. CH.3 connects to SEJOUR through D1 and D2
4. CH.1 connects to SEJOUR through D4
5. CUISINE connects to SEJOUR through D5 and D6

Now, let's create the navigation plan to move from CH.2 to SEJOUR:

```json
{
  "start": "CH.2",
  "end": "SEJOUR",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

This plan is the most efficient route from CH.2 to SEJOUR. You only need to use one door (D3) to reach your destination. The plan avoids unnecessary doors and rooms, providing a direct path to the SEJOUR area.
