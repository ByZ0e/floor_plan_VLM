Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and their door connections, then provide a navigation plan from CHAMBRE PARENTS to CELLIER.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CHAMBRE PARENTS: D8
2. BAINS: D7
3. BUREAU: D6
4. LINGERIE: D5
5. WC: D4
6. HALL (central area): D5, D6, D7, D8, D9, D10, D11
7. CHAMBRE ENFANT 1: D10
8. CHAMBRE ENFANT 2: D9
9. CELLIER: D1, D2, D3, D11
10. GARAGE: D1
11. PORCHE: D2

Navigation Plan:
To go from CHAMBRE PARENTS to CELLIER, we need to use the following path:
CHAMBRE PARENTS -> HALL -> CELLIER

Here's the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 11}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from CHAMBRE PARENTS to CELLIER using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
