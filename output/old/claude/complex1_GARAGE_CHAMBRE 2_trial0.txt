First, let's list out the rooms and doors with their connections based on the floor plan:

Rooms and Doors:
1. GARAGE - connected to CELLIER via D9
2. CELLIER - connected to GARAGE via D9, to HALL via D1
3. HALL - central area connecting multiple rooms
4. BAINS - connected to HALL via D2
5. WC - connected to HALL via D3
6. CHAMBRE 1 - connected to HALL via D4
7. CHAMBRE 2 - connected to HALL via D5
8. PORCHE - connected to HALL via D6
9. CUISINE - connected to HALL via D7
10. TERRASSE COUVERTE - connected to CUISINE via D8

Now, let's create the navigation plan from GARAGE to CHAMBRE 2:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from the GARAGE to CHAMBRE 2:
1. Start in GARAGE
2. Go through D9 to enter CELLIER
3. Go through D1 to enter the central HALL area
4. Go through D5 to reach CHAMBRE 2

This path avoids any unnecessary detours and uses only the doors required to reach the destination.
