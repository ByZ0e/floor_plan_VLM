Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and their door connections, then provide the navigation plan from BUREAU to BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
1. BUREAU: Connected to HALL via D6
2. HALL: Connected to LINGERIE via D5, BAINS via D7, CHAMBRE PARENTS via D8, CHAMBRE ENFANT 2 via D9
3. LINGERIE: Connected to HALL via D5, WC via D4
4. WC: Connected to LINGERIE via D4
5. BAINS: Connected to HALL via D7
6. CHAMBRE PARENTS: Connected to HALL via D8
7. CHAMBRE ENFANT 2: Connected to HALL via D9
8. CHAMBRE ENFANT 1: Connected to HALL via D10
9. CELLIER: Connected to HALL via D3, GARAGE via D1, PORCHE via D2
10. GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER via D1
11. PORCHE: Connected to CELLIER via D2

Navigation Plan from BUREAU to BAINS:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the BUREAU to the BAINS using only the necessary doors. The path goes through the HALL, which connects both rooms directly.
