First, let's identify the rooms and doors with their connections based on the floor plan:

Rooms:
- SEJOUR (large living area)
- CUISINE (kitchen)
- CELLIER (cellar)
- CH.1 (Bedroom 1)
- CH.2 (Bedroom 2)
- DEGT (likely a hallway or degagement)
- BAINS (bathroom)
- WC (toilet)

Doors:
D1: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
D2: Connects CUISINE to CELLIER
D3: Connects CUISINE to SEJOUR
D4: Connects SEJOUR to DEGT
D5: Connects DEGT to CH.1
D6: Connects DEGT to CH.2
D7: Connects DEGT to BAINS
D8: Connects DEGT to WC

Now, for the navigation plan from SEJOUR to CH.1:

Step-by-step solution:
1. We start in SEJOUR
2. We need to go through D4 to reach DEGT
3. From DEGT, we go through D5 to reach CH.1

Here's the efficient navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from SEJOUR to CH.1 using only the necessary doors (D4 and D5) without any unnecessary detours or actions.
