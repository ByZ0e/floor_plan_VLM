Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the CELLIER to the HALL.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CELLIER connects to CUISINE through D3
2. CUISINE connects to HALL through D6
3. HALL connects to multiple areas, including the target HALL area

Navigation Plan:
To get from the CELLIER to the HALL, we need to go through the CUISINE. Here's the step-by-step plan:

{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"}
  ]
}

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the CELLIER to the HALL area, using only the necessary doors (D3 and D6) and passing through the CUISINE. The final step brings you into the HALL area, which is your destination.
