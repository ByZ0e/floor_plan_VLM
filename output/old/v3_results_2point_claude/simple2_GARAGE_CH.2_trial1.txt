Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the GARAGE to CH.2.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects BAINS to HALL
2. D2 connects CH.1 to HALL
3. D3 connects CH.2 to HALL
4. D4 connects GARAGE to HALL
5. D5 connects CUISINE to HALL

Now, let's create the navigation plan from GARAGE to CH.2:

{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}

This plan will efficiently guide you from the GARAGE to CH.2 using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
