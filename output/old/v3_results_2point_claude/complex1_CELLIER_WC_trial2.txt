Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan to get from the CELLIER to the WC.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
2. D2: Connects HALL to WC
3. D3: Connects HALL to HALL (different sections)
4. D4: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
5. D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 2
6. D6: Connects HALL to PORCHE
7. D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE
8. D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
9. D9: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE

Navigation Plan:
To get from the CELLIER to the WC, we need to use two doors: D1 and D2. Here's the step-by-step plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the CELLIER to the WC using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
