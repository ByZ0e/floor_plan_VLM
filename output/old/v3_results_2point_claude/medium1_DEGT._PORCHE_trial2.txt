Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from DEGT to PORCHE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects SEJOUR to PORCHE
2. D2 connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
3. D3 connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
4. D4 connects SEJOUR to DEGT
5. D5 connects DEGT to CH.1
6. D6 connects DEGT to CH.2
7. D7 connects CUISINE to BAINS
8. D8 connects CUISINE to DEGT

Based on these connections, here's the efficient navigation plan from DEGT to PORCHE:

```json
{
  "start": "DEGT",
  "end": "PORCHE",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan takes you from DEGT through the SEJOUR and directly to the PORCHE using the minimum number of necessary doors. The path avoids any unnecessary rooms or doors, providing an efficient route to your destination.
