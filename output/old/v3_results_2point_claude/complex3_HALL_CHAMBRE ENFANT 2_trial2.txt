Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER
D2: Connects CELLIER and PORCHE
D3: Connects PORCHE and HALL
D4: Connects HALL and WC
D5: Connects HALL and BUREAU
D6: Connects HALL and BAINS
D7: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE PARENTS
D8: Connects HALL and HALL (near CHAMBRE PARENTS)
D9: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
D10: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
D11: Connects CELLIER and HALL

Navigation Plan:
To go from HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2, we only need to use one door: D9.

Here's the step-by-step navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 9
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 9
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 9
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan takes you directly from the HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2 using the most efficient path, which only requires passing through one door (D9).
