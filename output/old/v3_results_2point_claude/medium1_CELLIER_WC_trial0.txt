Thank you for providing the floor plan image. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
- CELLIER connects to CUISINE through D2
- CUISINE connects to SEJOUR through D3
- SEJOUR connects to DEGT through D4
- DEGT connects to CH.1 through D5
- DEGT connects to CH.2 through D6
- DEGT connects to BAINS through D7
- BAINS connects to WC through D8

Now, for the navigation plan from CELLIER to WC:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the CELLIER to the WC using only the necessary doors and rooms. The path goes through CELLIER -> CUISINE -> SEJOUR -> DEGT -> BAINS -> WC, which is the most direct route based on the floor plan provided.
