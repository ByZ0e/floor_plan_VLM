Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the GARAGE to CH.2.

Rooms and Doors:
1. GARAGE: Connected to CUISINE via D4
2. CUISINE: Connected to GARAGE via D4, connected to HALL via D5
3. HALL: Connected to CUISINE via D5, connected to CH.2 via D3, connected to CH.1 via D2
4. CH.1: Connected to HALL via D2
5. CH.2: Connected to HALL via D3
6. BAINS: Connected to HALL via D1

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan from GARAGE to CH.2:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently guide you from the GARAGE to CH.2 using only the necessary doors. The path goes through the CUISINE and HALL before reaching CH.2, avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
