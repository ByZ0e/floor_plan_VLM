Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: GARAGE <-> CELLIER
D2: CELLIER <-> PORCHE
D3: PORCHE <-> HALL
D4: HALL <-> WC
D5: HALL <-> LINGERIE
D6: HALL <-> BUREAU
D7: HALL <-> BAINS
D8: HALL <-> CHAMBRE PARENTS
D9: HALL <-> CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
D10: HALL <-> CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
D11: CELLIER <-> HALL

Navigation Plan:
To go from HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2, we only need to use one door: D9.

Here's the step-by-step navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 9
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 9
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 9
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently take you from the HALL directly to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2 using the most direct path available.
