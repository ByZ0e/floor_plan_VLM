Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms and doors, create a list of connections, and then provide a navigation plan for you to move from the CUISINE to the DOUCHE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects TERRASSE COUVERTE and CUISINE
2. D2 connects CUISINE and CELLIER
3. D3 connects CUISINE and CH. PARENTS
4. D4 connects CH. PARENTS and DOUCHE

Now, let's create the navigation plan based on these connections:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently guide you from the CUISINE to the DOUCHE using the following steps:
1. Approach door D3 (which connects CUISINE to CH. PARENTS)
2. Open door D3
3. Go through door D3 to enter CH. PARENTS
4. Approach door D4 (which connects CH. PARENTS to DOUCHE)
5. Open door D4
6. Go through door D4 to reach the DOUCHE

This plan uses only the necessary doors (D3 and D4) to reach your destination efficiently, avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
