Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from CH.2 to SEJOUR.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CH.2 is connected to SEJOUR through D2
2. CH.2 is connected to SEJOUR through D3
3. CH.1 is connected to SEJOUR through D4
4. CH.3 is connected to SEJOUR through D1
5. SEJOUR is connected to CUISINE through D5 and D6

Now, for the navigation plan from CH.2 to SEJOUR:

The most direct path from CH.2 to SEJOUR is through door D2 or D3. Since both are equally valid, I'll use D2 for this plan.

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CH.2",
  "end": "SEJOUR",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from CH.2 to SEJOUR using the most direct path available.
