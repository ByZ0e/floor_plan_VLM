Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from CHAMBRE PARENTS to CELLIER.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER
D2: Connects CELLIER and PORCHE
D3: Connects PORCHE and HALL
D4: Connects HALL and WC
D5: Connects HALL and BUREAU
D6: Connects HALL and BAINS
D7: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE PARENTS
D8: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE PARENTS
D9: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
D10: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
D11: Connects HALL and CELLIER

Navigation Plan:
To go from CHAMBRE PARENTS to CELLIER, we need to use the following sequence of actions:

{
  "actions": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 11}
  ]
}

This plan efficiently navigates from CHAMBRE PARENTS to CELLIER using the minimum number of necessary doors. The robot will exit the CHAMBRE PARENTS through door D8, enter the HALL, and then use door D11 to reach the CELLIER.
