Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the CUISINE to CHAMBRE 1.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects CELLIER and HALL
D2: Connects HALL and WC
D3: Connects HALL and BAINS
D4: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 1
D5: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 2
D6: Connects HALL and PORCHE
D7: Connects HALL and CUISINE
D8: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Connects CELLIER and GARAGE

Now, let's create the navigation plan from CUISINE to CHAMBRE 1:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the CUISINE to CHAMBRE 1 using only the necessary doors. The path goes through the HALL, which connects both rooms. No unnecessary doors or rooms are included in this plan.
