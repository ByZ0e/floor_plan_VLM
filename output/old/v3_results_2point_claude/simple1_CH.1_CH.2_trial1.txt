Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from CH.1 to CH.2.

Rooms and Doors:
1. CH.1: Connected to SEJOUR through D4
2. CH.2: Connected to SEJOUR through D3
3. CH.3: Connected to SEJOUR through D2 and D1
4. SEJOUR (multiple areas): Connected to CH.1 (D4), CH.2 (D3), CH.3 (D2, D1), and CUISINE (D6)
5. CUISINE: Connected to SEJOUR through D6 and D5

Door Connections:
- D1: Connects CH.3 and SEJOUR
- D2: Connects CH.3 and SEJOUR
- D3: Connects CH.2 and SEJOUR
- D4: Connects CH.1 and SEJOUR
- D5: Connects CUISINE and SEJOUR
- D6: Connects CUISINE and SEJOUR

Now, let's create the navigation plan from CH.1 to CH.2:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CH.1 to CH.2 using only the necessary doors (D4 and D3) and passing through the SEJOUR area. The plan avoids unnecessary rooms and doors, providing a direct path to the destination.
