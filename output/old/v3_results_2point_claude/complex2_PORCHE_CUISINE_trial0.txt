Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms, doors, and their connections, then provide you with a navigation plan from the PORCHE to the CUISINE.

Explicit Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects CELLIER and HALL
D2: Connects CHAMBRE 2 and HALL
D3: Connects HALL and BAINS
D4: Connects HALL and WC
D5: Connects PORCHE and HALL
D6: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 1
D7: Connects HALL and CUISINE
D8: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER

Step-by-step navigation plan from PORCHE to CUISINE:

1. ApproachDoor(5)
2. OpenDoor(5)
3. GoThrough(5)
4. ApproachDoor(7)
5. OpenDoor(7)
6. GoThrough(7)

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "PORCHE",
  "end": "CUISINE",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from the PORCHE to the CUISINE, using only the necessary doors (D5 and D7) to reach the destination.
