Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from CH.2 to SEJOUR.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CH.2 connects to SEJOUR (large central area) via D2
2. CH.3 connects to SEJOUR (left side) via D1
3. CH.1 connects to SEJOUR (top right) via D4
4. CUISINE connects to SEJOUR (bottom right) via D5 and D6
5. The large central SEJOUR area connects to the smaller SEJOUR areas

Navigation Plan:
To go from CH.2 to SEJOUR, we only need to use one door (D2). Here's the detailed plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CH.2",
  "end": "SEJOUR",
  "path": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D2"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D2"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D2"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from CH.2 to the SEJOUR area using the most direct path available. After going through door D2, you will be in the large central SEJOUR area, which is connected to the other SEJOUR areas without needing to go through any additional doors.
