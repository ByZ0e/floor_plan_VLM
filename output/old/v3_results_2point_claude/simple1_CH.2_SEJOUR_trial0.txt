Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
- CH.2 is connected to SEJOUR through D2
- CH.2 is connected to CH.3 through D2
- CH.3 is connected to SEJOUR through D1
- CH.1 is connected to SEJOUR through D4
- CUISINE is connected to SEJOUR through D5 and D6

Based on these connections, here's the navigation plan to go from CH.2 to SEJOUR:

```json
{
  "start": "CH.2",
  "end": "SEJOUR",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"}
  ]
}
```

This plan is the most efficient route from CH.2 to SEJOUR. You only need to use one door (D2) to reach your destination. Once you go through D2, you'll be in the SEJOUR area, which completes the navigation task.
