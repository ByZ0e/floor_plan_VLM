Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan from PORCHE to CUISINE.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
D2: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to HALL
D3: Connects HALL to BAINS
D4: Connects HALL to WC
D5: Connects PORCHE to HALL
D6: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE
D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER

Now, for the navigation plan from PORCHE to CUISINE:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from PORCHE to CUISINE using only the necessary doors. The robot starts in PORCHE, goes through D5 to enter the HALL, and then uses D7 to reach the CUISINE. No unnecessary doors or rooms are included in this path.
