Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms, doors, and their connections, then provide a navigation plan from the WC to CHAMBRE 2.

Room and Door Connections:
1. WC connects to HALL via D3
2. HALL connects to CHAMBRE 1 via D2
3. HALL connects to CHAMBRE 3 via D5
4. HALL connects to CHAMBRE 2 via D6
5. HALL connects to CELLIER via D7
6. CELLIER connects to GARAGE via D1
7. HALL connects to Porche via D8
8. BAINS connects to HALL via D4

Navigation Plan:
To go from WC to CHAMBRE 2, we need to use the following sequence of actions:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the WC to CHAMBRE 2 using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
