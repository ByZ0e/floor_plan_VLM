Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and their door connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from BAINS to TERRASSE COUVERTE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. BAINS: Connected to HALL via D2
2. WC: Connected to HALL via D3
3. CELLIER: Connected to GARAGE via D9
4. GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER via D9
5. CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL via D5
6. CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D4
7. CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D7 and to TERRASSE COUVERTE via D8
8. PORCHE: Connected to HALL via D6
9. HALL: Central area connected to multiple rooms (D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7)
10. TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE via D8

Navigation Plan:
To go from BAINS to TERRASSE COUVERTE, we need to pass through the HALL and CUISINE. Here's the step-by-step plan:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from BAINS to TERRASSE COUVERTE using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
