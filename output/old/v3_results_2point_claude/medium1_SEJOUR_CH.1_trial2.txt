Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from SEJOUR to CH.1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. SEJOUR connects to CUISINE through D1
2. SEJOUR connects to DEGT through D4
3. CUISINE connects to CELLIER through D2
4. CUISINE connects to another part of CUISINE through D3
5. DEGT connects to CH.1 through D5
6. DEGT connects to CH.2 through D6
7. BAINS connects to DEGT through D7
8. WC connects to DEGT through D8

Navigation Plan:
To go from SEJOUR to CH.1, we need to use the following doors: D4 and D5.

Here's the step-by-step navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D5"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D5"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D5"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the SEJOUR to CH.1 using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
