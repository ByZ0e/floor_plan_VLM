Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms, doors, and connections, then provide you with a navigation plan from the DOUCHE to the CELLIER.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

Rooms:
- DOUCHE
- CH. PARENTS
- CUISINE (multiple areas)
- CELLIER (two separate areas)
- TERRASSE COUVERTE

Doors and their connections:
D1: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE and CUISINE
D2: Connects CUISINE and CELLIER
D3: Connects CH. PARENTS and CUISINE
D4: Connects DOUCHE and CUISINE

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan from DOUCHE to CELLIER:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the DOUCHE to the CELLIER using the necessary doors. The path goes through the CUISINE, which connects both the starting and ending points. The plan avoids unnecessary doors and rooms, providing a direct route to your destination.
