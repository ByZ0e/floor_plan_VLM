Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the CELLIER to the WC.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects CELLIER and SEJOUR
- D2: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
- D3: Connects CUISINE and larger SEJOUR area
- D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT (Dégagement, which appears to be a hallway or passage)
- D5: Connects DEGT and CH.1
- D6: Connects DEGT and CH.2
- D7: Connects DEGT and BAINS
- D8: Connects DEGT and WC

Navigation Plan:
To navigate from the CELLIER to the WC, we need to go through the following doors: D1, D2, D3, D4, and D8.

Here's the step-by-step navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan will efficiently guide you from the CELLIER to the WC using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
