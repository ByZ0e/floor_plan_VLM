Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms, doors, and their connections, then provide a navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CH. PARENTS connects to CUISINE through D3
2. CUISINE connects to DOUCHE through D4
3. CUISINE connects to CELLIER through D2
4. CUISINE connects to TERRASSE COUVERTE through D1

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan to get from CH. PARENTS to TERRASSE COUVERTE:

{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}

This plan will efficiently navigate you from CH. PARENTS to TERRASSE COUVERTE using only the necessary doors and rooms. The path goes through CUISINE, which connects both the starting and ending points.
