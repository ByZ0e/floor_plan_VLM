Certainly! I'll analyze the floor plan, list the room and door connections, and then provide a detailed navigation plan as requested.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects GARAGES to CELLIER
D2: Connects HALL to DOUCHE
D3: Connects CELLIER to CUISINE
D4: Connects HALL to WC
D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
D6: Connects HALL to CUISINE
D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE (different part of the kitchen)

Now, let's create the navigation plan from CHAMBRE 1 to GARAGES:

{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}

This navigation plan provides the most efficient path from CHAMBRE 1 to GARAGES, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours. The plan takes you from CHAMBRE 1 through the HALL, into the CUISINE, then to the CELLIER, and finally into the GARAGES area.
