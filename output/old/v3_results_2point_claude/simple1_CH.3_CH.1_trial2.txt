Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan to get from CH.3 to CH.1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CH.3 connects to SEJOUR through D1
2. CH.3 connects to CH.2 through D2
3. CH.2 connects to SEJOUR through D3
4. CH.1 connects to SEJOUR through D4
5. CUISINE connects to SEJOUR through D5 and D6

Navigation Plan:
To get from CH.3 to CH.1, we need to go through the SEJOUR. Here's the step-by-step plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CH.3 to CH.1 using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
