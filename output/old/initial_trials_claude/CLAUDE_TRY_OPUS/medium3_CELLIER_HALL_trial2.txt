Here is the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D1"  
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor", 
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D4"
    }
  ]
}
```

The plan navigates from the CELLIER through D1 into the HALL, then directly to the destination in the HALL, using only the necessary doors D1 and D4.
