Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the GARAGE to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER
D2: Connects CELLIER to PORCHE
D3: Connects PORCHE to HALL
D4: Connects HALL to WC
D5: Connects HALL to LINGERIE
D6: Connects HALL to BUREAU
D7: Connects HALL to BAINS
D8: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE PARENTS
D9: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
D10: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
D11: Connects CELLIER to HALL

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan from GARAGE to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 11},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 10}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from the GARAGE to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours. The robot will start in the GARAGE, go through the CELLIER, enter the HALL, and finally reach CHAMBRE ENFANT 1.
