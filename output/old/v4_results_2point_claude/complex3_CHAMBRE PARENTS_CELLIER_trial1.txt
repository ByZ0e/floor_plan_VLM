Navigation Plan:
To go from CHAMBRE PARENTS to CELLIER, we'll use the following sequence of actions:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 11}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CHAMBRE PARENTS to CELLIER using the most direct route available based on the provided floor plan and door connections.
