Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the CELLIER to CHAMBRE 3.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: GARAGE <-> CELLIER
2. D2: CHAMBRE 1 <-> HALL
3. D3: HALL <-> WC
4. D4: HALL <-> BAINS
5. D5: HALL <-> CHAMBRE 3
6. D6: HALL <-> CHAMBRE 2
7. D7: CELLIER <-> HALL
8. D8: HALL <-> Porche

Now, I'll create a step-by-step navigation plan from CELLIER to CHAMBRE 3:

{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5}
  ]
}

This plan efficiently navigates from the CELLIER to CHAMBRE 3 using only the necessary doors. It avoids unnecessary rooms and ensures a correct path to the destination.
