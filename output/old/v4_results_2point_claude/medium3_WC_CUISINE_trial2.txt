Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the WC to the CUISINE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects GARAGES to CELLIER
2. D2 connects GARAGES to DOUCHE
3. D3 connects CELLIER to CUISINE
4. D4 connects WC to HALL
5. D5 connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
6. D6 connects HALL to CUISINE
7. D7 connects HALL to CUISINE (second entrance)

Now, for the navigation plan from WC to CUISINE:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the WC to the CUISINE using the following steps:
1. Exit the WC through D4 into the HALL
2. From the HALL, enter the CUISINE through D6

This is the most direct route based on the floor plan and the given door connections. It avoids unnecessary rooms and uses only the required doors to reach the destination.
