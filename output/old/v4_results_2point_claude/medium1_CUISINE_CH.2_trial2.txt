Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the CUISINE to CH.2.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects SEJOUR and Porche
- D2: Connects CUISINE and CELLIER
- D3: Connects CUISINE and SEJOUR
- D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
- D5: Connects CH.1 and DEGT
- D6: Connects CH.2 and DEGT
- D7: Connects BAINS and DEGT
- D8: Connects WC and DEGT

Now, let's create the navigation plan from CUISINE to CH.2:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the CUISINE to CH.2 using only the necessary doors. The path goes through SEJOUR and DEGT to reach CH.2, which is the most direct route based on the floor plan provided.
