Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the CUISINE to CH.1.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects BAINS to HALL
D2: Connects CH.1 to HALL
D3: Connects CH.2 to HALL
D4: Connects GARAGE to CUISINE
D5: Connects CUISINE to HALL

Now, I'll create a step-by-step navigation plan from CUISINE to CH.1:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the CUISINE to CH.1 using only the necessary doors. It starts by exiting the CUISINE through D5 into the HALL, then enters CH.1 through D2. This is the most direct route based on the floor plan provided.
