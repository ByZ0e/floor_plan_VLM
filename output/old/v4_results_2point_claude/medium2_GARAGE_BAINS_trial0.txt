Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the GARAGE to the BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
- GARAGE: D1 connects to HALL
- CHAMBRE 1: D2 connects to HALL
- BAINS: D4 connects to HALL
- CHAMBRE 3: D5 connects to HALL
- CHAMBRE 2: D6 connects to HALL
- CELLIER: D7 connects to HALL
- Porche: D8 connects to HALL
- WC: D3 connects to HALL

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan from GARAGE to BAINS:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the GARAGE to the BAINS using only the necessary doors. The robot starts in the GARAGE, goes through D1 to enter the HALL, and then goes through D4 to reach the BAINS. No unnecessary rooms or doors are included in this path.
