Certainly! I'll analyze the floor plan, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan for you to move from CH.1 to the GARAGE.

Explicit Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects CH.1 to HALL
2. D2 connects CH.1 to HALL
3. D3 connects CH.2 to HALL
4. D4 connects GARAGE to CUISINE
5. D5 connects CUISINE to HALL

Now, let's create the navigation plan based on these connections:

To go from CH.1 to GARAGE, we need to:
1. Exit CH.1 through D2 to reach HALL
2. Move through HALL to reach CUISINE through D5
3. Enter GARAGE from CUISINE through D4

Here's the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "doorNumber": 2
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "doorNumber": 2
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "doorNumber": 2
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "doorNumber": 5
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "doorNumber": 5
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "doorNumber": 5
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "doorNumber": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "doorNumber": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "doorNumber": 4
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from CH.1 to GARAGE using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors. The plan takes into account that doors close after each GoThrough action, so each door needs to be approached and opened before going through.
