Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the BUREAU to the BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER
- D2: Connects CELLIER and PORCHE
- D3: Connects PORCHE and HALL
- D4: Connects HALL and WC
- D5: Connects LINGERIE and HALL
- D6: Connects BUREAU and HALL
- D7: Connects HALL and BAINS
- D8: Connects BAINS and CHAMBRE PARENTS
- D9: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
- D10: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
- D11: Connects CELLIER and HALL

Navigation Plan:
To go from the BUREAU to the BAINS, we need to use doors D6 and D7. Here's the step-by-step plan:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the BUREAU to the BAINS using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
