Certainly! I'll analyze the floor plan, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from CELLIER to CHAMBRE 3.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER
2. D2: Connects CHAMBRE 1 and HALL
3. D3: Connects HALL and WC
4. D4: Connects HALL and BAINS
5. D5: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 3
6. D6: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 2
7. D7: Connects CELLIER and HALL
8. D8: Connects HALL and Porche

Navigation Plan:
To go from CELLIER to CHAMBRE 3, we need to use two doors: D7 and D5. Here's the step-by-step plan:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CELLIER to CHAMBRE 3 using only the necessary doors. It first exits the CELLIER into the HALL using D7, then enters CHAMBRE 3 from the HALL using D5. The plan avoids unnecessary rooms and doors, providing a direct path to the destination.
