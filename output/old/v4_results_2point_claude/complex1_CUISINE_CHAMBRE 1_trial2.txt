Certainly! I'll provide you with a detailed navigation plan based on the floor plan image. First, let's establish the room and door connections:

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects CELLIER and HALL
D2: Connects BAINS and HALL
D3: Connects WC and HALL
D4: Connects CHAMBRE 1 and HALL
D5: Connects CHAMBRE 2 and HALL
D6: Connects PORCHE and HALL
D7: Connects CUISINE and HALL
D8: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Connects CELLIER and GARAGE

Now, for the navigation task from CUISINE to CHAMBRE 1, here's the detailed plan:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

Explanation of the plan:
1. Start in the CUISINE
2. Approach Door 7 (D7), which connects CUISINE to HALL
3. Open Door 7
4. Go through Door 7 to enter the HALL
5. In the HALL, approach Door 4 (D4), which connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
6. Open Door 4
7. Go through Door 4 to enter CHAMBRE 1

This plan provides the most efficient route from the CUISINE to CHAMBRE 1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours. The plan takes into account that doors close after each GoThrough action, so we open each door before going through it.
