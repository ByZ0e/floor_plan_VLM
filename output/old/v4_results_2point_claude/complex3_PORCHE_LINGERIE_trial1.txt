Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the PORCHE to the LINGERIE.

Explicit Room and Door Connections:
- D1: GARAGE <-> CELLIER
- D2: PORCHE <-> CELLIER
- D3: PORCHE <-> HALL
- D4: HALL <-> WC
- D5: HALL <-> LINGERIE
- D6: HALL <-> BUREAU
- D7: HALL <-> BAINS
- D8: HALL <-> CHAMBRE PARENTS
- D9: HALL <-> CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
- D10: HALL <-> CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
- D11: CELLIER <-> HALL

Now, for the navigation plan from PORCHE to LINGERIE:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the PORCHE to the LINGERIE using the minimum number of necessary doors. The robot starts in the PORCHE, goes through door D3 to enter the HALL, and then uses door D5 to reach the LINGERIE. This is the most direct path based on the provided floor plan and door connections.
