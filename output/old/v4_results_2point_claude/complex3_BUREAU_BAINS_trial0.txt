Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan from BUREAU to BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER
- D2: Connects CELLIER and PORCHE
- D3: Connects PORCHE and HALL
- D4: Connects HALL and WC
- D5: Connects HALL and LINGERIE
- D6: Connects HALL and BUREAU
- D7: Connects HALL and BAINS
- D8: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE PARENTS
- D9: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
- D10: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
- D11: Connects CELLIER and HALL

Navigation Plan from BUREAU to BAINS:
Based on the floor plan and the connections listed above, here's the efficient navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7}
  ]
}
```

This plan takes you from the BUREAU to the BAINS using the most direct route through the HALL. The plan ensures that you only use the necessary doors (D6 and D7) to reach your destination efficiently.
