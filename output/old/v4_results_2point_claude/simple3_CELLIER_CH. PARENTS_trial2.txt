Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

1. CELLIER connects to CUISINE through D2
2. CUISINE (top left) connects to TERRASSE COUVERTE through D1
3. CUISINE (large central area) connects to CH. PARENTS through D3
4. CH. PARENTS connects to DOUCHE through D4

Navigation Plan:

To navigate from CELLIER to CH. PARENTS, we need to use doors D2 and D3. Here's the detailed plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently guide you from the CELLIER to CH. PARENTS using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
