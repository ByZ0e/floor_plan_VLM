Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan to get from the WC to the CUISINE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects GARAGES to CELLIER
2. D2 connects GARAGES to DOUCHE
3. D3 connects CELLIER to CUISINE
4. D4 connects WC to HALL
5. D5 connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
6. D6 connects HALL to CUISINE
7. D7 connects HALL to CUISINE (second entrance)

Now, for the navigation plan from WC to CUISINE:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the WC to the CUISINE using the shortest path and only the necessary doors. The robot will exit the WC through D4 into the HALL, then enter the CUISINE through D6. This route avoids any unnecessary rooms or doors.
