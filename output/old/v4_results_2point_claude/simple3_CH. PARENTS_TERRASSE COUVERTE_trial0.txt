Thank you for providing the floor plan. Let me start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections based on the image:

Rooms and Door Connections:
1. CH. PARENTS connects to CUISINE through D3
2. CUISINE connects to DOUCHE through D4
3. CUISINE connects to CELLIER through D2
4. CELLIER connects to another CUISINE area through D2
5. The other CUISINE area connects to TERRASSE COUVERTE through D1

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan to go from CH. PARENTS to TERRASSE COUVERTE:

{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}

This plan efficiently navigates from CH. PARENTS to TERRASSE COUVERTE using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours. The robot will start in CH. PARENTS, go through the CUISINE areas, and finally reach the TERRASSE COUVERTE.
