Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the WC to the BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
1. WC connects to DEGT through D8
2. DEGT connects to CH.2 through D6
3. DEGT connects to CH.1 through D5
4. DEGT connects to SEJOUR through D4
5. CUISINE connects to SEJOUR through D3
6. CUISINE connects to CELLIER through D2
7. SEJOUR connects to Porche through D1
8. BAINS connects to DEGT through D7

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
1. ApproachDoor(8)
2. OpenDoor(8)
3. GoThrough(8)
4. ApproachDoor(7)
5. OpenDoor(7)
6. GoThrough(7)

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "doorNumber": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "doorNumber": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "doorNumber": 8},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "doorNumber": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "doorNumber": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "doorNumber": 7}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from the WC to the BAINS, using only the necessary doors (D8 and D7) to reach the destination.
