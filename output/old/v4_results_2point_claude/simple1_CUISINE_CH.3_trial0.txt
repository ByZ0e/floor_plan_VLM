Thank you for providing the floor plan. Let me first describe the rooms and doors with their connections based on the image:

Room and Door Connections:
1. CUISINE connects to SEJOUR through D5
2. SEJOUR connects to CH.2 through D3
3. SEJOUR connects to CH.1 through D4
4. CH.2 connects to CH.3 through D2
5. CH.3 connects to SEJOUR through D1
6. SEJOUR connects to CUISINE through D6

Now, let's create the navigation plan to go from CUISINE to CH.3:

{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2}
  ]
}

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the CUISINE to CH.3 using the necessary doors and rooms. The path goes through CUISINE -> SEJOUR -> CH.2 -> CH.3, which is the most direct route based on the floor plan provided.
