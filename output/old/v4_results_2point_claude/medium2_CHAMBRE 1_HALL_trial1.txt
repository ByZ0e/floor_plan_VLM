Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from CHAMBRE 1 to the HALL.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER
- D2: Connects CHAMBRE 1 to HALL
- D3: Connects HALL to WC
- D4: Connects HALL to BAINS
- D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 3
- D6: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 2
- D7: Connects CELLIER to HALL
- D8: Connects HALL to Porche

Navigation Plan:
To go from CHAMBRE 1 to HALL, we only need to use one door: D2.

Here's the step-by-step navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from CHAMBRE 1 to the HALL using the most direct path available according to the floor plan.
