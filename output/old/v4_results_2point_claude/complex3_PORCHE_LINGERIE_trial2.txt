Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the PORCHE to the LINGERIE.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER
- D2: Connects PORCHE and CELLIER
- D3: Connects PORCHE and HALL
- D4: Connects HALL and WC
- D5: Connects HALL and LINGERIE
- D6: Connects HALL and BUREAU
- D7: Connects HALL and BAINS
- D8: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE PARENTS
- D9: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
- D10: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
- D11: Connects CELLIER and HALL

Navigation Plan:
To go from PORCHE to LINGERIE, we need to use doors D3 and D5.

Here's the step-by-step navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the PORCHE to the LINGERIE using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
