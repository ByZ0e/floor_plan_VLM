First, let me describe the rooms and doors as shown in the floor plan:

Rooms:
- GARAGE
- CHAMBRE 1
- CHAMBRE 2
- CHAMBRE 3
- BAINS
- WC
- CELLIER (3 small storage areas)
- HALL (multiple connected areas)
- Porche (porch)

Doors:
D1: Between GARAGE and CELLIER
D2: Between CHAMBRE 1 and HALL
D3: Between WC and HALL
D4: Between BAINS and HALL
D5: Between CHAMBRE 3 and HALL
D6: Between CHAMBRE 2 and HALL
D7: Between CELLIER and HALL
D8: Between HALL and Porche

Now, for the navigation plan from CHAMBRE 3 to BAINS and then to HALL:

{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(D5)",
    "OpenDoor(D5)",
    "GoThrough(D5)",
    "ApproachDoor(D4)",
    "OpenDoor(D4)",
    "GoThrough(D4)",
    "ApproachDoor(D4)",
    "OpenDoor(D4)",
    "GoThrough(D4)"
  ]
}

This plan efficiently navigates from CHAMBRE 3 to BAINS and then to HALL using the minimum necessary doors. The robot starts in CHAMBRE 3, goes through D5 to enter the HALL, then through D4 to enter BAINS, and finally back through D4 to end up in the HALL.
