I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan.

Rooms and Doors:
- BAINS: connected to HALL via D7
- HALL: central area connecting multiple rooms
- CHAMBRE ENFANT 2: connected to HALL via D9
- GARAGE: connected to CELLIER via D1
- CELLIER: connected to HALL via D11

Navigation Plan:
To go from BAINS to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2, then to GARAGE, we need to use the following doors in sequence: D7, D9, D9, D11, and D1.

Here's the detailed plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from BAINS to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2 and then to GARAGE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
