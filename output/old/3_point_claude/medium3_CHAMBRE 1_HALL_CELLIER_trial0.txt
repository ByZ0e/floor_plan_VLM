Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
- CHAMBRE 1 connects to HALL via D5
- HALL connects to WC via D4
- HALL connects to DOUCHE via D2
- HALL connects to CUISINE via D6
- CUISINE connects to CELLIER via D3
- CELLIER connects to GARAGES via D1

Now, for the navigation plan from CHAMBRE 1 to CELLIER:

1. ApproachDoor(D5)
2. OpenDoor(D5)
3. GoThrough(D5)
4. ApproachDoor(D6)
5. OpenDoor(D6)
6. GoThrough(D6)
7. ApproachDoor(D3)
8. OpenDoor(D3)
9. GoThrough(D3)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"}
  ]
}
```

This path takes you from CHAMBRE 1 through the HALL and CUISINE to reach CELLIER, using only the necessary doors along the way.
