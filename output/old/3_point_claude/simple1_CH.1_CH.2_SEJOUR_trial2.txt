First, let's explicitly list out the rooms and doors with their connections:

Rooms:
- CH.1
- CH.2
- CH.3
- SEJOUR (multiple areas labeled as SEJOUR)
- CUISINE

Doors:
- D1: Connects CH.3 to SEJOUR
- D2: Connects CH.3 to CH.2
- D3: Connects CH.2 to SEJOUR
- D4: Connects CH.1 to SEJOUR
- D5: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
- D6: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE (another entrance)

Now, for the navigation plan from CH.1 to CH.2, then to SEJOUR:

1. Start in CH.1
2. To get to CH.2, we need to go through SEJOUR
3. From CH.2, we can directly access SEJOUR

Here's the efficient navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CH.1 to CH.2 and then to SEJOUR using only the necessary doors. It avoids unnecessary rooms and doors, providing the most direct path to accomplish the given task.
