Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan as requested.

Rooms and Doors:

CH.1: Connected to HALL via D2
CH.2: Connected to HALL via D3
BAINS: Connected to HALL via D1
GARAGE: Connected to CUISINE via D4
CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D5
HALL: Central area connecting all rooms

Now, for the navigation plan from CH.1 to CH.2 to BAINS:

{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(D2)",
    "OpenDoor(D2)",
    "GoThrough(D2)",
    "ApproachDoor(D3)",
    "OpenDoor(D3)",
    "GoThrough(D3)",
    "ApproachDoor(D3)",
    "OpenDoor(D3)",
    "GoThrough(D3)",
    "ApproachDoor(D1)",
    "OpenDoor(D1)",
    "GoThrough(D1)"
  ]
}

This plan efficiently navigates from CH.1 to CH.2 and then to BAINS using only the necessary doors. It avoids any unnecessary rooms or doors, and accounts for doors closing after each GoThrough action.
