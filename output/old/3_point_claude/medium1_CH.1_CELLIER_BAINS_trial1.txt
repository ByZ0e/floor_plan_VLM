Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors, and then provide you with a navigation plan to go from CH.1 to CELLIER and finally to BAINS.

Room and Door Descriptions:
- CH.1: Connected to SEJOUR via D5
- SEJOUR: Connected to CH.1 via D5, to CUISINE via D3, to DEGT via D4
- CUISINE: Connected to SEJOUR via D3, to CELLIER via D2
- CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE via D2
- DEGT: Connected to SEJOUR via D4, to CH.2 via D6, to BAINS via D7
- CH.2: Connected to DEGT via D6
- BAINS: Connected to DEGT via D7

Now, let's create the navigation plan:

{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "target": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "target": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "target": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "target": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "target": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "target": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "target": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "target": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "target": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "target": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "target": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "target": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "target": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "target": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "target": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "target": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "target": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "target": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "target": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "target": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "target": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "target": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "target": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "target": "D7"}
  ]
}

This navigation plan will efficiently guide you from CH.1 to CELLIER and then to BAINS, using only the necessary doors along the path.
