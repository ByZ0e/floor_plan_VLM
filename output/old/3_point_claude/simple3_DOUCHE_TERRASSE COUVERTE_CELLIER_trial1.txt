First, let's list out the rooms and doors with their connections:

Rooms:
1. DOUCHE
2. CH. PARENTS
3. CUISINE (large central area)
4. CELLIER
5. TERRASSE COUVERTE

Doors:
D1: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE to CUISINE
D2: Connects CELLIER to CUISINE
D3: Connects CH. PARENTS to CUISINE
D4: Connects DOUCHE to CUISINE

Now, for the navigation plan:

The path from DOUCHE to TERRASSE COUVERTE, then to CELLIER would be:
1. Exit DOUCHE to CUISINE
2. Cross CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
3. Return to CUISINE
4. Go from CUISINE to CELLIER

Here's the detailed plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from DOUCHE to TERRASSE COUVERTE and then to CELLIER, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
