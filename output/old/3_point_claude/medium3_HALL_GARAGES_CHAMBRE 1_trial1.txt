Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan as requested.

Rooms and Doors:
- HALL: Connected to CUISINE (D6), WC (D4), DOUCHE (D2), and CHAMBRE 1 (D5)
- CUISINE: Connected to HALL (D6) and CELLIER (D3)
- CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE (D3) and GARAGES (D1)
- GARAGES: Connected to CELLIER (D1)
- WC: Connected to HALL (D4)
- DOUCHE: Connected to HALL (D2)
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL (D5)

Now, for the navigation plan from HALL to GARAGES to CHAMBRE 1:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the HALL to GARAGES and then to CHAMBRE 1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
