Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a detailed navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
- CUISINE: Connected to CELLIER via D6, and to HALL via D7
- CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE via D6, and to GARAGES via D1
- GARAGES: Connected to CELLIER via D1
- HALL: Connected to CUISINE via D7, to WC via D4, and to CHAMBRE 1 via D5
- WC: Connected to HALL via D4
- DOUCHE: Connected to HALL via D2
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D5

Now, for the navigation plan from CUISINE to DOUCHE to HALL:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CUISINE to DOUCHE and then back to HALL using the necessary doors. It avoids any unnecessary rooms or doors, providing a direct path as requested.
