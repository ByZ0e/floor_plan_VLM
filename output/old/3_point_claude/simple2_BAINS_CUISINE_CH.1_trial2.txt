First, let me describe the rooms and doors based on the floor plan:

Rooms:
- BAINS (Bathroom)
- CH.1 (Bedroom 1)
- CH.2 (Bedroom 2)
- GARAGE
- CUISINE (Kitchen)
- Multiple HALL areas

Doors:
- D1: Connects BAINS to the small HALL area
- D2: Connects CH.1 to the small HALL area
- D3: Connects CH.2 to the small HALL area
- D4: Connects GARAGE to CUISINE
- D5: Connects CUISINE to the HALL area

Now, for the navigation plan from BAINS to CUISINE to CH.1:

1. Start in BAINS
2. Use D1 to exit BAINS and enter the small HALL
3. Move through the HALL areas to reach CUISINE
4. Use D5 to enter CUISINE
5. Exit CUISINE through D5 back to HALL
6. Move through HALL areas to reach the small HALL near CH.1
7. Use D2 to enter CH.1

Here's the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from BAINS to CUISINE and then to CH.1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
