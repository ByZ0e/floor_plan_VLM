First, let me list out the rooms and doors with their connections based on the floor plan:

Rooms and Connections:
- CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D7, to TERRASSE COUVERTE via D8
- PORCHE: Connected to HALL via D6
- BAINS: Connected to HALL via D2
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D4
- CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL via D5
- CELLIER: Connected to HALL via D1, to GARAGE via D9
- GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER via D9
- WC: Connected to HALL via D3
- HALL: Central area connecting most rooms

Now, for the navigation plan from CUISINE to PORCHE to BAINS:

{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"}
  ]
}

This plan efficiently navigates from CUISINE to PORCHE, then to BAINS, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
