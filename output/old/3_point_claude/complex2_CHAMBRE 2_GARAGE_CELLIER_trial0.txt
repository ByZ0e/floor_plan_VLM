Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
- CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL via D2
- GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER via D9
- CELLIER: Connected to GARAGE via D9, and to HALL via D1
- HALL: Connected to multiple rooms (CHAMBRE 2, CELLIER, BAINS, WC, CHAMBRE 1, CUISINE)
- CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D7
- PORCHE: Connected to HALL via D5
- TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE via D8
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D6
- BAINS: Connected to HALL via D3
- WC: Connected to HALL via D4

Now, for the navigation plan from CHAMBRE 2 to GARAGE, then to CELLIER:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates you from CHAMBRE 2 to GARAGE and then to CELLIER using only the necessary doors. The path goes through the HALL to reach the CELLIER, then to the GARAGE, and finally back to the CELLIER as requested.
