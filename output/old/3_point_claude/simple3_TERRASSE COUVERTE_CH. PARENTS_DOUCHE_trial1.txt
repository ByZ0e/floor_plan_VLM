Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide you with a detailed navigation plan as requested.

Rooms and Doors:
1. TERRASSE COUVERTE - connected to CUISINE via D1
2. CUISINE - connected to TERRASSE COUVERTE via D1, to CELLIER via D2
3. CELLIER - connected to CUISINE via D2
4. CH. PARENTS - connected to CUISINE via D3
5. DOUCHE - connected to CH. PARENTS via D4

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan to go from TERRASSE COUVERTE to CH. PARENTS and then to DOUCHE:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates you from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to the DOUCHE, passing through the CH. PARENTS as required. It uses only the necessary doors (D1, D3, and D4) and avoids any unnecessary detours or rooms.
