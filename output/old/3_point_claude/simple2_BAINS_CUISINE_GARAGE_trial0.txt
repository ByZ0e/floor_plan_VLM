Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout and provide you with a detailed navigation plan as requested. First, let me list out the rooms and doors with their connections:

Rooms and their connections:
- BAINS: Connected to CH.1 via D1
- CH.1: Connected to BAINS via D1, and to hallway via D2
- CH.2: Connected to hallway via D3
- GARAGE: Connected to CUISINE via D4
- CUISINE: Connected to GARAGE via D4, and to hallway via D5

Doors and the rooms they connect:
- D1: Connects BAINS and CH.1
- D2: Connects CH.1 and hallway
- D3: Connects CH.2 and hallway
- D4: Connects GARAGE and CUISINE
- D5: Connects CUISINE and hallway

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan to go from BAINS to CUISINE, and then to GARAGE:

{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(D1)",
    "OpenDoor(D1)",
    "GoThrough(D1)",
    "ApproachDoor(D2)",
    "OpenDoor(D2)",
    "GoThrough(D2)",
    "ApproachDoor(D5)",
    "OpenDoor(D5)",
    "GoThrough(D5)",
    "ApproachDoor(D4)",
    "OpenDoor(D4)",
    "GoThrough(D4)"
  ]
}

This plan efficiently navigates you from BAINS to CUISINE and finally to GARAGE, using only the necessary doors along the path.
