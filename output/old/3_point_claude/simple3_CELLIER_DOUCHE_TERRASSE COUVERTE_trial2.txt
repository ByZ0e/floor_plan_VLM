First, let me describe the rooms and doors as shown in the floor plan:

Rooms:
1. CELLIER
2. CUISINE (multiple connected areas labeled as CUISINE)
3. DOUCHE
4. CH. PARENTS
5. TERRASSE COUVERTE

Doors:
D1: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE to CUISINE
D2: Connects CELLIER to CUISINE
D3: Connects CUISINE to CH. PARENTS
D4: Connects CH. PARENTS to DOUCHE

Now, for the navigation plan from CELLIER to DOUCHE to TERRASSE COUVERTE:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CELLIER to DOUCHE and then to TERRASSE COUVERTE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
