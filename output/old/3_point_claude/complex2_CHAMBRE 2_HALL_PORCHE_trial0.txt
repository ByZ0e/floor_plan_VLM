Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first describe the rooms and doors, then provide the navigation plan.

Room and Door Descriptions:
- CHAMBRE 2 connects to HALL via door D2
- HALL connects to PORCHE via door D5
- HALL connects multiple rooms and areas

Navigation Plan:
To go from CHAMBRE 2 to PORCHE via HALL, we need to use two doors: D2 and D5. Here's the detailed plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently guide you from CHAMBRE 2 to PORCHE via HALL, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
