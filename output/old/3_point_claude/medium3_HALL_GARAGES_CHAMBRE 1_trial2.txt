Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide you with an efficient navigation plan as requested.

Rooms and Doors:
- HALL: Connected to CUISINE (D6), WC (D4), CHAMBRE 1 (D5), and DOUCHE (D2)
- CUISINE: Connected to HALL (D6) and CELLIER (D3)
- CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE (D3) and GARAGES (D1)
- GARAGES: Connected to CELLIER (D1)
- WC: Connected to HALL (D4)
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL (D5)
- DOUCHE: Connected to HALL (D2)

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan to go from HALL to GARAGES, and then to CHAMBRE 1:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the HALL to GARAGES and then to CHAMBRE 1, using only the necessary doors along the path. The plan accounts for doors closing after each GoThrough action, ensuring that all required doors are opened when needed.
