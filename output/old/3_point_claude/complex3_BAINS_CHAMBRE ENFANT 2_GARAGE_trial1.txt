Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide an efficient navigation plan for your route from BAINS to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2 and finally to GARAGE.

Rooms and Doors:

- BAINS: Connected to HALL via D7
- CHAMBRE PARENTS: Connected to HALL via D8
- BUREAU: Connected to HALL via D6
- LINGERIE: Connected to HALL via D5
- WC: Connected to HALL via D4
- CELLIER: Connected to HALL via D3, and to GARAGE via D1 and D2
- GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER via D1
- CHAMBRE ENFANT 1: Connected to HALL via D10
- CHAMBRE ENFANT 2: Connected to HALL via D9
- HALL: Central area connecting most rooms

Navigation Plan:

To go from BAINS to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2 and then to GARAGE, here's the efficient path:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"}
  ]
}
```

This path takes you from BAINS through the HALL, to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2, back through the HALL, through the CELLIER, and finally into the GARAGE, using only the necessary doors along the way.
