Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by describing the rooms and doors, then provide a navigation plan to get from CH.3 to CH.1 via CH.2.

Room and Door Descriptions:
- CH.3: Connected to SEJOUR via D1 and to CH.2 via D2
- CH.2: Connected to CH.3 via D2 and to SEJOUR via D3
- CH.1: Connected to SEJOUR via D4
- SEJOUR: Large central area connected to all rooms
- CUISINE: Connected to SEJOUR via D6 (not relevant for this path)
- D5: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE (not relevant for this path)

Navigation Plan:
To go from CH.3 to CH.1 via CH.2, we need to use doors D2, D3, and D4. Here's the efficient navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently take you from CH.3 to CH.2, and then to CH.1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
