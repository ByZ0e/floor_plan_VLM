Thank you for providing the floor plan. Let me first list out the rooms and doors with their connections for reference:

Rooms and their connections:
- CUISINE: Connected to HALL and TERRASSE COUVERTE
- CELLIER: Connected to HALL and GARAGE
- GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL
- CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL
- BAINS: Connected to HALL
- WC: Connected to HALL
- PORCHE: Connected to HALL
- TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE

Doors:
D1: Connects CELLIER and HALL
D2: Connects WC and HALL
D3: Connects HALL (near WC) and HALL (near CHAMBRE 1)
D4: Connects CHAMBRE 1 and HALL
D5: Connects CHAMBRE 2 and HALL
D6: Connects PORCHE and HALL
D7: Connects CUISINE and HALL
D8: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Connects CELLIER and GARAGE

Now, for the navigation plan from CUISINE to CELLIER to GARAGE:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"}
  ]
}
```

This path efficiently navigates from the CUISINE to the CELLIER and finally to the GARAGE using only the necessary doors. The plan avoids any unnecessary rooms or doors, providing a direct route to the destination.
