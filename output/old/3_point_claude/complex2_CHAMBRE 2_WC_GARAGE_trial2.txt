Thank you for providing the floor plan. Let me first list out the rooms and doors with their connections for reference:

Rooms and their connections:
- CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL via D2
- HALL: Central area connecting multiple rooms
- WC: Connected to HALL via D4
- GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER via D9
- CELLIER: Connected to HALL via D1

Doors:
D1: Connects CELLIER and HALL
D2: Connects CHAMBRE 2 and HALL
D3: Connects BAINS and HALL
D4: Connects WC and HALL
D5: Connects PORCHE and HALL
D6: Connects CHAMBRE 1 and HALL
D7: Connects CUISINE and HALL
D8: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan to go from CHAMBRE 2 to WC, and then to GARAGE:

```json
{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(D2)",
    "OpenDoor(D2)",
    "GoThrough(D2)",
    "ApproachDoor(D4)",
    "OpenDoor(D4)",
    "GoThrough(D4)",
    "ApproachDoor(D4)",
    "OpenDoor(D4)",
    "GoThrough(D4)",
    "ApproachDoor(D1)",
    "OpenDoor(D1)",
    "GoThrough(D1)",
    "ApproachDoor(D9)",
    "OpenDoor(D9)",
    "GoThrough(D9)"
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CHAMBRE 2 to WC and then to GARAGE using only the necessary doors. It avoids any unnecessary rooms or doors and provides the correct path based on the floor plan provided.
