To begin, I'll list out the rooms and doors with their connections based on the floor plan:

Rooms:
- CH.1
- CH.2
- CH.3
- SEJOUR (multiple areas labeled as SEJOUR)
- CUISINE

Doors:
- D1: Connects CH.3 to SEJOUR
- D2: Connects CH.3 to CH.2
- D3: Connects CH.2 to SEJOUR
- D4: Connects CH.1 to SEJOUR
- D5: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
- D6: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE (another entrance)

Now, for the navigation plan from CH.1 to CH.2 to SEJOUR:

1. Start in CH.1
2. Use D4 to enter SEJOUR
3. Use D3 to enter CH.2
4. Use D3 again to return to SEJOUR

Here's the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D3"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D3"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D3"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D3"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D3"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D3"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CH.1 to CH.2 and finally to SEJOUR, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
