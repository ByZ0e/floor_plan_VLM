Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan as requested.

Rooms and Doors:
- DEGT: Connected to CH.1 via D5, CH.2 via D6, SEJOUR via D4, and BAINS via D7
- CH.1: Connected to DEGT via D5
- CH.2: Connected to DEGT via D6
- SEJOUR: Connected to DEGT via D4, CUISINE via D3, and Porche via D1
- CUISINE: Connected to SEJOUR via D3 and CELLIER via D2
- CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE via D2
- BAINS: Connected to DEGT via D7
- WC: Connected to BAINS via D8
- Porche: Connected to SEJOUR via D1

Navigation Plan:
To go from DEGT to CH.2 and then to CH.1, we need the following sequence of actions:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from DEGT to CH.2, then back to DEGT, and finally to CH.1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
