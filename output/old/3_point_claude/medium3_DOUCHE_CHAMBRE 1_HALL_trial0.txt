Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan as requested.

Rooms and Doors:
- DOUCHE: Connected to HALL via D2
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D5
- HALL: Central area connecting multiple rooms
- CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D6 and D7
- CELLIER: Connected to GARAGES via D1 and to CUISINE via D3
- WC: Connected to HALL via D4
- GARAGES: Large area with multiple sections

Now, for the navigation plan from DOUCHE to CHAMBRE 1 and finally to HALL:

{
  "plan": [
    "ApproachDoor(D2)",
    "OpenDoor(D2)",
    "GoThrough(D2)",
    "ApproachDoor(D5)",
    "OpenDoor(D5)",
    "GoThrough(D5)",
    "ApproachDoor(D5)",
    "OpenDoor(D5)",
    "GoThrough(D5)"
  ]
}

This plan efficiently navigates from the DOUCHE to CHAMBRE 1 and then back to the HALL using only the necessary doors. The robot starts in DOUCHE, goes through D2 to enter the HALL, then through D5 to enter CHAMBRE 1, and finally back through D5 to return to the HALL, which is the final destination.
