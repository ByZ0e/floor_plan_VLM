Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan as requested.

Rooms and Doors:
- CELLIER: Connected to HALL via D1
- GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER via D9
- BAINS: Connected to HALL via D2
- WC: Connected to HALL via D3
- CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL via D5
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D4
- CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D7
- PORCHE: Connected to HALL via D6
- TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE via D8

Now, for the navigation plan from CELLIER to CHAMBRE 1:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CELLIER to CHAMBRE 1 using only the necessary doors. It starts in CELLIER, goes through D1 to enter the HALL, and then uses D4 to enter CHAMBRE 1, completing the requested navigation task.
