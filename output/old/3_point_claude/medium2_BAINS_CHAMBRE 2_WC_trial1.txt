Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
- BAINS: Connected to HALL via D4
- WC: Connected to HALL via D3
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D2
- CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL via D6
- CHAMBRE 3: Connected to HALL via D5
- GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER via D1
- CELLIER: Connected to HALL via D7
- HALL: Central area connecting most rooms
- Porche: Connected to HALL via D8

Now, for the navigation plan from BAINS to CHAMBRE 2 to WC:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from BAINS to CHAMBRE 2 and then to WC, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors. The plan accounts for doors closing after each GoThrough action, ensuring that each door is approached and opened when needed.
