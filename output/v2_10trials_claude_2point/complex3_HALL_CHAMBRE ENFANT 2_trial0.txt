Certainly! I'll provide you with a detailed navigation plan based on the floor plan image. Let's start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections:

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects HALL to CELLIER
2. D2: Connects CELLIER to PORCHE
3. D3: Connects PORCHE to HALL
4. D4: Connects HALL to WC
5. D5: Connects HALL to LINGERIE
6. D6: Connects HALL to BUREAU
7. D7: Connects HALL to BAINS
8. D8: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE PARENTS
9. D9: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
10. D10: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
11. D11: Connects HALL to CELLIER

Now, let's create a step-by-step navigation plan to go from the HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2:

1. We start in the HALL
2. Approach door D9
3. Open door D9
4. Go through door D9 to enter CHAMBRE ENFANT 2

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 9}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
