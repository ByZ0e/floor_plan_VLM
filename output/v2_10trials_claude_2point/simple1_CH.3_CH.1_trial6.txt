Certainly! I'll analyze the floor plan, list the room and door connections, and then provide a detailed navigation plan for you to move from CH.3 to CH.1.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

1. D1 connects CH.3 to SEJOUR (left side)
2. D2 connects CH.2 to SEJOUR (left side)
3. D3 connects CH.2 to SEJOUR (center)
4. D4 connects CH.1 to SEJOUR (right side)
5. D5 connects CUISINE to SEJOUR (bottom right)
6. D6 connects CUISINE to SEJOUR (bottom center)

Now, let's create the navigation plan to go from CH.3 to CH.1:

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CH.3
2. Use D1 to enter the left SEJOUR
3. Cross the SEJOUR to reach D4
4. Use D4 to enter CH.1

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from CH.3 to CH.1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours. The robot will start in CH.3, go through D1 to enter the SEJOUR, cross the SEJOUR, and then use D4 to enter CH.1, completing the navigation task.
