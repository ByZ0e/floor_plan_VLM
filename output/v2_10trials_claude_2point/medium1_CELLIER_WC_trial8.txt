Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. Let me start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections based on the image:

Room and Door Connections:
1. CELLIER connects to CUISINE through D2
2. CUISINE connects to SEJOUR through D3
3. SEJOUR connects to CH.1 through D4
4. CH.1 connects to DEGT through D5
5. DEGT connects to CH.2 through D6
6. DEGT connects to BAINS through D7
7. DEGT connects to WC through D8

Now, let's create a step-by-step navigation plan to get from the CELLIER to the WC:

1. Start in CELLIER
2. ApproachDoor(D2)
3. OpenDoor(D2)
4. GoThrough(D2) to enter CUISINE
5. ApproachDoor(D3)
6. OpenDoor(D3)
7. GoThrough(D3) to enter SEJOUR
8. ApproachDoor(D4)
9. OpenDoor(D4)
10. GoThrough(D4) to enter CH.1
11. ApproachDoor(D5)
12. OpenDoor(D5)
13. GoThrough(D5) to enter DEGT
14. ApproachDoor(D8)
15. OpenDoor(D8)
16. GoThrough(D8) to enter WC

Now, I'll provide the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"}
  ]
}
```

This path efficiently navigates from the CELLIER to the WC using only the necessary doors and rooms.
