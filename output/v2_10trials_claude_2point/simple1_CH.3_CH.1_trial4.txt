Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from CH.3 to CH.1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects CH.3 and SEJOUR (left side)
2. D2 connects CH.2 and SEJOUR (left side)
3. D3 connects CH.2 and SEJOUR (middle)
4. D4 connects CH.1 and SEJOUR (right side)
5. D5 connects CUISINE and SEJOUR (bottom right)
6. D6 connects CUISINE and SEJOUR (bottom)

Now, let's create a step-by-step navigation plan from CH.3 to CH.1:

1. Start in CH.3
2. ApproachDoor(1)
3. OpenDoor(1)
4. GoThrough(1) - Now in SEJOUR (left side)
5. ApproachDoor(4)
6. OpenDoor(4)
7. GoThrough(4) - Now in CH.1 (destination reached)

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CH.3",
  "end": "CH.1",
  "actions": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from CH.3 to CH.1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
