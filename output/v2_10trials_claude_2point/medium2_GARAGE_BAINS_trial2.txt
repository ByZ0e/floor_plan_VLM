Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the GARAGE to the BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects GARAGE to HALL
2. D2: Connects CHAMBRE1 to HALL
3. D3: Connects HALL to WC
4. D4: Connects HALL to BAINS
5. D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE3
6. D6: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE2
7. D7: Connects CELLIER to HALL
8. D8: Connects HALL to Porche

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in the GARAGE
2. ApproachDoor(D1)
3. OpenDoor(D1)
4. GoThrough(D1) to enter the HALL
5. ApproachDoor(D4)
6. OpenDoor(D4)
7. GoThrough(D4) to enter the BAINS

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "GARAGE",
  "end": "BAINS",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from the GARAGE to the BAINS, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
