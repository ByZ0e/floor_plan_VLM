Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects SEJOUR and Porche
- D2: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
- D3: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
- D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
- D5: Connects CH.1 and DEGT
- D6: Connects CH.2 and DEGT
- D7: Connects DEGT and BAINS
- D8: Connects DEGT and WC

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
1. Start in WC
2. ApproachDoor(8)
3. OpenDoor(8)
4. GoThrough(8) to enter DEGT
5. ApproachDoor(7)
6. OpenDoor(7)
7. GoThrough(7) to enter BAINS

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "WC",
  "end": "BAINS",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from the WC to the BAINS, using only the necessary doors (D8 and D7) to reach the destination. The plan takes into account that doors close after each GoThrough action, so each door needs to be approached and opened before going through.
