Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the DOUCHE to CHAMBRE 1.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

1. D1: Connects GARAGES to CELLIER
2. D2: Connects GARAGES to DOUCHE
3. D3: Connects CELLIER to CUISINE
4. D4: Connects WC to HALL
5. D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
6. D6: Connects HALL to CUISINE
7. D7: Connects CUISINE to HALL

Step-by-step solution:

1. Start in DOUCHE
2. Use D2 to enter GARAGES
3. Use D1 to enter CELLIER
4. Use D3 to enter CUISINE
5. Use D6 to enter HALL
6. Use D5 to enter CHAMBRE 1

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan will efficiently guide you from the DOUCHE to CHAMBRE 1 using only the necessary doors and rooms.
