Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects Garage to Hall
2. D2: Connects Chambre 1 to Hall
3. D3: Connects WC to Hall
4. D4: Connects Bains to Hall
5. D5: Connects Chambre 3 to Hall
6. D6: Connects Chambre 2 to Hall
7. D7: Connects Cellier to Hall
8. D8: Connects Hall to Porche

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in Bains
2. ApproachDoor(D4)
3. OpenDoor(D4)
4. GoThrough(D4) to enter Hall
5. ApproachDoor(D8)
6. OpenDoor(D8)
7. GoThrough(D8) to reach Porche

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "Bains",
  "end": "Porche",
  "steps": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from Bains to Porche, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
