Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms, doors, and their connections, then provide a navigation plan for you to move from CH.2 to SEJOUR.

Explicit Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects CH.3 and SEJOUR
2. D2 connects CH.2 and CH.3
3. D3 connects CH.2 and SEJOUR
4. D4 connects CH.1 and SEJOUR
5. D5 connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
6. D6 connects SEJOUR and CUISINE

Now, let's create the navigation plan to move from CH.2 to SEJOUR:

Step-by-step solution:
1. You are currently in CH.2.
2. The most direct path to SEJOUR is through D3.
3. Approach D3, open it, and go through to reach SEJOUR.

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 3
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from CH.2 to SEJOUR using only the necessary doors and actions.
