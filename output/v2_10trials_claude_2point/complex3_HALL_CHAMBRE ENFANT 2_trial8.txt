I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections based on the floor plan image:

Doors and Room Connections:
D1: Connects HALL to CELLIER
D2: Connects CELLIER to PORCHE
D3: Connects PORCHE to HALL
D4: Connects HALL to WC
D5: Connects HALL to LINGERIE
D6: Connects HALL to BUREAU
D7: Connects HALL to BAINS
D8: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE PARENTS
D9: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
D10: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
D11: Connects CELLIER to HALL

Now, I'll provide the step-by-step navigation plan to go from HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2:

Step 1: We start in the HALL.
Step 2: Approach door D9, which connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2.
Step 3: Open door D9.
Step 4: Go through door D9 to enter CHAMBRE ENFANT 2.

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D9"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D9"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D9"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from the HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2, using only the necessary door (D9) to reach the destination.
