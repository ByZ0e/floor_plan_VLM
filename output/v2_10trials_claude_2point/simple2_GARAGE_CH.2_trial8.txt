Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from the GARAGE to CH.2.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects HALL to BAINS
2. D2: Connects HALL to CH.1
3. D3: Connects HALL to CH.2
4. D4: Connects GARAGE to CUISINE
5. D5: Connects HALL to CUISINE

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in the GARAGE
2. Approach D4 (connecting GARAGE to CUISINE)
3. Open D4
4. Go through D4 to enter CUISINE
5. Approach D5 (connecting CUISINE to HALL)
6. Open D5
7. Go through D5 to enter HALL
8. Approach D3 (connecting HALL to CH.2)
9. Open D3
10. Go through D3 to enter CH.2

Now, I'll provide the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan provides the most efficient path from the GARAGE to CH.2, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
