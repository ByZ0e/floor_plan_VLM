Certainly! I'll analyze the floor plan, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan for you to move from the CELLIER to the WC.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
D2: Connects HALL to BAINS
D3: Connects HALL to WC
D4: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 2
D6: Connects HALL to PORCHE
D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE
D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE

Step-by-step solution:

1. Start in CELLIER
2. Use D1 to enter HALL
3. Use D3 to enter WC

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 3
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from the CELLIER to the WC, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
