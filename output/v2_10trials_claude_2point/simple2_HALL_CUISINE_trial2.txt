Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the HALL to the CUISINE.

Rooms and Doors with Connections:

1. HALL: Connected to CH.1, CH.2, GARAGE, and CUISINE
2. CH.1: Connected to HALL via D2
3. CH.2: Connected to HALL via D3
4. BAINS: Connected to HALL via D1
5. GARAGE: Connected to HALL via D4
6. CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D5

Doors:
D1: Connects HALL and BAINS
D2: Connects HALL and CH.1
D3: Connects HALL and CH.2
D4: Connects HALL and GARAGE
D5: Connects HALL and CUISINE

Navigation Plan:
To go from HALL to CUISINE, we only need to use one door: D5.

Here's the step-by-step plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 5
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 5
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 5
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the HALL to the CUISINE using only the necessary door (D5) without passing through any unnecessary rooms or doors.
