Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from CHAMBRE PARENTS to CELLIER.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D8: Connects CHAMBRE PARENTS to HALL
2. D7: Connects HALL to BAINS
3. D6: Connects HALL to BUREAU
4. D5: Connects HALL to LINGERIE
5. D4: Connects HALL to WC
6. D3: Connects HALL to PORCHE
7. D2: Connects PORCHE to CELLIER
8. D1: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE
9. D9: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
10. D10: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
11. D11: Connects HALL to CELLIER

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in CHAMBRE PARENTS
2. Use D8 to enter HALL
3. Use D11 to enter CELLIER

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 8
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 8
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 8
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 11
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 11
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 11
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from CHAMBRE PARENTS to CELLIER, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
