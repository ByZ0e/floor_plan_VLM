Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the CELLIER to the WC.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
D2: Connects HALL to BAINS
D3: Connects HALL to WC
D4: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 2
D6: Connects HALL to PORCHE
D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE
D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE

Navigation Plan:
To go from the CELLIER to the WC, we need to use two doors: D1 and D3. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(1)
2. OpenDoor(1)
3. GoThrough(1)
4. ApproachDoor(3)
5. OpenDoor(3)
6. GoThrough(3)

Now, I'll provide the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan will efficiently guide you from the CELLIER to the WC using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
