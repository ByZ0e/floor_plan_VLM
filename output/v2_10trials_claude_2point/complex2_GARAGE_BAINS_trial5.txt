Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the GARAGE to the BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D9: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER
2. D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
3. D2: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to HALL
4. D5: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to PORCHE
5. D3: Connects HALL to BAINS
6. D4: Connects HALL to WC
7. D6: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
8. D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE
9. D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in GARAGE
2. ApproachDoor(D9)
3. OpenDoor(D9)
4. GoThrough(D9) to enter CELLIER
5. ApproachDoor(D1)
6. OpenDoor(D1)
7. GoThrough(D1) to enter HALL
8. ApproachDoor(D3)
9. OpenDoor(D3)
10. GoThrough(D3) to reach BAINS

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "GARAGE",
  "end": "BAINS",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the GARAGE to the BAINS, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
