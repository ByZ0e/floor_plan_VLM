Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from DEGT to PORCHE.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects SEJOUR and PORCHE
D2: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
D3: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
D5: Connects CH.1 and DEGT
D6: Connects CH.2 and DEGT
D7: Connects BAINS and DEGT
D8: Connects WC and DEGT

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in DEGT
2. ApproachDoor(D4)
3. OpenDoor(D4)
4. GoThrough(D4) to enter SEJOUR
5. ApproachDoor(D1)
6. OpenDoor(D1)
7. GoThrough(D1) to reach PORCHE

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "DEGT",
  "end": "PORCHE",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from DEGT to PORCHE using only the necessary doors. The robot will start in DEGT, move through SEJOUR, and finally reach PORCHE.
