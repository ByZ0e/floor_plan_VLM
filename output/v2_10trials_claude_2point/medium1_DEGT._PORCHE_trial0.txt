Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from DEGT to PORCHE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects SEJOUR to PORCHE
2. D2: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
3. D3: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
4. D4: Connects SEJOUR to DEGT
5. D5: Connects CH.1 to DEGT
6. D6: Connects CH.2 to DEGT
7. D7: Connects BAINS to DEGT
8. D8: Connects WC to DEGT

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in DEGT
2. ApproachDoor(D4)
3. OpenDoor(D4)
4. GoThrough(D4) - Now in SEJOUR
5. ApproachDoor(D1)
6. OpenDoor(D1)
7. GoThrough(D1) - Now in PORCHE

JSON format of the final path:
```json
{
  "start": "DEGT",
  "end": "PORCHE",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan provides the most direct and efficient route from DEGT to PORCHE using only the necessary doors. The plan avoids any unnecessary rooms or doors and ensures that each action is correct for traversal to the end goal.
