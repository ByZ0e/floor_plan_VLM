Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the CELLIER to the WC.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D2: Connects CELLIER and CUISINE
2. D3: Connects CUISINE and SEJOUR
3. D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
4. D7: Connects DEGT and BAINS
5. D8: Connects DEGT and WC

Navigation Plan:

To go from CELLIER to WC, we need to follow this path: CELLIER -> CUISINE -> SEJOUR -> DEGT -> WC

Here's the detailed step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(2)
2. OpenDoor(2)
3. GoThrough(2)
4. ApproachDoor(3)
5. OpenDoor(3)
6. GoThrough(3)
7. ApproachDoor(4)
8. OpenDoor(4)
9. GoThrough(4)
10. ApproachDoor(8)
11. OpenDoor(8)
12. GoThrough(8)

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the CELLIER to the WC using only the necessary doors and rooms along the path.
