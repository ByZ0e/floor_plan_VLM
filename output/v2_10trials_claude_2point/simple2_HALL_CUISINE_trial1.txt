Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the HALL to the CUISINE.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:
1. D1 connects HALL to BAINS
2. D2 connects HALL to CH.1
3. D3 connects HALL to CH.2
4. D4 connects HALL to GARAGE
5. D5 connects HALL to CUISINE

Based on these connections, here's the step-by-step navigation plan to get from the HALL to the CUISINE:

1. ApproachDoor(5)
2. OpenDoor(5)
3. GoThrough(5)

This is the most efficient path as it directly connects the HALL to the CUISINE using only one door (D5).

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5}
  ]
}
```

This plan ensures that you start in the HALL and arrive at the CUISINE using the most direct route available, utilizing only the necessary door (D5) to reach your destination.
