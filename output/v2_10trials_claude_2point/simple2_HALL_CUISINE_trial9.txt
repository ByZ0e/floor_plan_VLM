Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the HALL to the CUISINE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects HALL to BAINS
2. D2 connects HALL to CH.1
3. D3 connects HALL to CH.2
4. D4 connects HALL to GARAGE
5. D5 connects HALL to CUISINE

Based on these connections, here's the navigation plan to get from HALL to CUISINE:

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in HALL
2. Approach D5
3. Open D5
4. Go through D5 to enter CUISINE

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the HALL to the CUISINE, using only the necessary door (D5) to reach the destination. No unnecessary doors or rooms are included in the path.
