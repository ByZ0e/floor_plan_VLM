Thank you for providing the floor plan and instructions. I'll first list the rooms and door connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the WC to the BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects SEJOUR and Porche
2. D2: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
3. D3: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
4. D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
5. D5: Connects CH.1 and DEGT
6. D6: Connects CH.2 and DEGT
7. D7: Connects DEGT and BAINS
8. D8: Connects DEGT and WC

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in WC
2. ApproachDoor(D8)
3. OpenDoor(D8)
4. GoThrough(D8) to enter DEGT
5. ApproachDoor(D7)
6. OpenDoor(D7)
7. GoThrough(D7) to arrive at BAINS

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "WC",
  "end": "BAINS",
  "actions": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the WC to the BAINS, using only the necessary doors (D8 and D7) and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
