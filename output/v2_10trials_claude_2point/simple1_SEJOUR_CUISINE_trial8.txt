Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms, doors, and their connections, then provide you with a detailed navigation plan to get from the SEJOUR to the CUISINE.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

Rooms:
- SEJOUR (multiple instances)
- CH.1
- CH.2 (two instances)
- CH.3 (two instances)
- CUISINE

Doors and their connections:
D1: Connects SEJOUR to CH.3
D2: Connects CH.3 to CH.2
D3: Connects CH.2 to SEJOUR
D4: Connects SEJOUR to CH.1
D5: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
D6: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in SEJOUR
2. Locate door D5 or D6 (both lead to CUISINE)
3. Approach the chosen door (D5 in this case, as it's slightly closer)
4. Open the door
5. Go through the door to enter CUISINE

Based on this analysis, here's the efficient navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "SEJOUR",
  "end": "CUISINE",
  "actions": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 5
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 5
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 5
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct route from the SEJOUR to the CUISINE using the minimum number of necessary actions. The robot will approach door D5, open it, and go through to reach the CUISINE, completing the navigation task efficiently.
