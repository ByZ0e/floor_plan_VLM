Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the CUISINE to CH.1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects BAINS to the central HALL
2. D2 connects CH.1 to the central HALL
3. D3 connects CH.2 to the central HALL
4. D4 connects GARAGE to CUISINE
5. D5 connects CUISINE to the lower HALL

Navigation Plan:

To go from CUISINE to CH.1, we need to:
1. Exit CUISINE to the lower HALL through D5
2. Move through the HALL to reach D2
3. Enter CH.1 through D2

Here's the detailed action plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the CUISINE to CH.1 using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors. The robot will start in the CUISINE, exit through D5 into the HALL, traverse the HALL, and then enter CH.1 through D2.
