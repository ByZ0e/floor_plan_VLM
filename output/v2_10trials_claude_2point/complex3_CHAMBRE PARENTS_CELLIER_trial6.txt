Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan from CHAMBRE PARENTS to CELLIER.

Rooms and Doors Connections:
1. D8 connects CHAMBRE PARENTS and HALL
2. D7 connects HALL and BAINS
3. D6 connects HALL and BUREAU
4. D5 connects HALL and LINGERIE
3. D3 connects HALL and PORCHE
4. D2 connects PORCHE and CELLIER
5. D1 connects CELLIER and GARAGE

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in CHAMBRE PARENTS
2. Use D8 to enter HALL
3. Move through HALL to D3
4. Use D3 to enter PORCHE
5. Use D2 to reach CELLIER (final destination)

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan in the requested JSON format with the necessary actions:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from CHAMBRE PARENTS to CELLIER, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
