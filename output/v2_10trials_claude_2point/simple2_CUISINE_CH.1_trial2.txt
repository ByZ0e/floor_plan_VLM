Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I'll list the rooms and doors with their connections based on the floor plan:

Rooms and Doors:
1. CUISINE - connected to GARAGE via D4, connected to HALL via D5
2. GARAGE - connected to CUISINE via D4
3. HALL - connected to CUISINE via D5, connected to CH.2 via D3, connected to CH.1 via D2, connected to BAINS via D1
4. CH.2 - connected to HALL via D3
5. CH.1 - connected to HALL via D2
6. BAINS - connected to HALL via D1

Now, let's create the navigation plan to go from CUISINE to CH.1:

1. Start in CUISINE
2. ApproachDoor(D5)
3. OpenDoor(D5)
4. GoThrough(D5) - Now in HALL
5. ApproachDoor(D2)
6. OpenDoor(D2)
7. GoThrough(D2) - Now in CH.1

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CUISINE",
  "end": "CH.1",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"}
  ]
}
```

This path is the most efficient route from CUISINE to CH.1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
