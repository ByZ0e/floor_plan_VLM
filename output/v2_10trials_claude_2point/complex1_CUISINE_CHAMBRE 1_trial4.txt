Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the CUISINE to CHAMBRE 1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects CELLIER and HALL
2. D2: Connects BAINS and HALL
3. D3: Connects WC and HALL
4. D4: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 1
5. D5: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 2
6. D6: Connects HALL and PORCHE
7. D7: Connects HALL and CUISINE
8. D8: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
9. D9: Connects CELLIER and GARAGE

Navigation Plan:
To go from CUISINE to CHAMBRE 1, we need to use the following doors: D7 and D4.

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CUISINE
2. Use D7 to enter HALL
3. In HALL, approach D4
4. Use D4 to enter CHAMBRE 1

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from CUISINE to CHAMBRE 1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
