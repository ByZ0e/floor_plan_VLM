Certainly! I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections based on the floor plan image, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from the BUREAU to the BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER
2. D2: Connects CELLIER and PORCHE
3. D3: Connects PORCHE and HALL
4. D4: Connects HALL and WC
5. D5: Connects HALL and LINGERIE
6. D6: Connects HALL and BUREAU
7. D7: Connects HALL and BAINS
8. D8: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE PARENTS
9. D9: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
10. D10: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
11. D11: Connects CELLIER and HALL

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in the BUREAU
2. ApproachDoor(D6)
3. OpenDoor(D6)
4. GoThrough(D6) to enter the HALL
5. ApproachDoor(D7)
6. OpenDoor(D7)
7. GoThrough(D7) to enter the BAINS

Now, I'll provide the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan provides the most efficient and correct path from the BUREAU to the BAINS, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
