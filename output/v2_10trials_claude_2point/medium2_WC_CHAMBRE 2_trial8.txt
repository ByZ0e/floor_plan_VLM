Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the WC to CHAMBRE 2.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects GARAGE to HALL
2. D2: Connects CHAMBRE 1 to HALL
3. D3: Connects WC to HALL
4. D4: Connects BAINS to HALL
5. D5: Connects CHAMBRE 3 to HALL
6. D6: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to HALL
7. D7: Connects CELLIER to HALL
8. D8: Connects HALL to Porche

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in WC
2. ApproachDoor(D3)
3. OpenDoor(D3)
4. GoThrough(D3) to enter HALL
5. ApproachDoor(D6)
6. OpenDoor(D6)
7. GoThrough(D6) to enter CHAMBRE 2

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "WC",
  "end": "CHAMBRE 2",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the WC to CHAMBRE 2, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
