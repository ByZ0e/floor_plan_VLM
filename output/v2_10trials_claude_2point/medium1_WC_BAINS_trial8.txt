Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the WC to the BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
1. WC: Connected to DEGT via D8
2. DEGT: Connected to WC via D8, SEJOUR via D4, CH.2 via D6, BAINS via D7
3. SEJOUR: Connected to DEGT via D4, CUISINE via D3
4. CUISINE: Connected to SEJOUR via D3
5. CH.1: Connected to SEJOUR via D5
6. CH.2: Connected to DEGT via D6
7. BAINS: Connected to DEGT via D7
8. CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE via D2
9. Porche: Connected to SEJOUR via D1

Now, let's create the navigation plan from WC to BAINS:

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in WC
2. Use D8 to go from WC to DEGT
3. Use D7 to go from DEGT to BAINS

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 8
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 8
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 8
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 7
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 7
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 7
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the WC to the BAINS, using only the necessary doors (D8 and D7) and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
