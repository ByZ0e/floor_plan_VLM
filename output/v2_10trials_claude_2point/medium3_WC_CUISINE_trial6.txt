Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a detailed navigation plan to get from the WC to the CUISINE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects GARAGES to CELLIER
2. D2: Connects GARAGES to DOUCHE
3. D3: Connects CELLIER to CUISINE
4. D4: Connects WC to HALL
5. D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
6. D6: Connects HALL to CUISINE
7. D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE (second entrance)

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in WC
2. ApproachDoor(D4)
3. OpenDoor(D4)
4. GoThrough(D4) to enter HALL
5. ApproachDoor(D6)
6. OpenDoor(D6)
7. GoThrough(D6) to enter CUISINE

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "WC",
  "end": "CUISINE",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from the WC to the CUISINE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
