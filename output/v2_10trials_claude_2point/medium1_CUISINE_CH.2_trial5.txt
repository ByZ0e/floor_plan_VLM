Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the CUISINE to CH.2.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects SEJOUR and Porche
D2: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
D3: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
D5: Connects CH.1 and DEGT
D6: Connects CH.2 and DEGT
D7: Connects BAINS and DEGT
D8: Connects WC and DEGT

Now, let's create the navigation plan from CUISINE to CH.2:

Step 1: Exit CUISINE to SEJOUR through D3
Step 2: Move from SEJOUR to DEGT through D4
Step 3: Enter CH.2 from DEGT through D6

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 6
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 6
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 6
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from CUISINE to CH.2, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
