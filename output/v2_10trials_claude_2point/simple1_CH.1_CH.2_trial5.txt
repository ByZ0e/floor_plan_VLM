Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the room and door connections, then provide a navigation plan from CH.1 to CH.2.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

1. CH.1 connects to SEJOUR through D4
2. SEJOUR connects to CH.2 through D3
3. CH.2 connects to CH.3 through D2
4. CH.3 connects to SEJOUR through D1
5. SEJOUR connects to CUISINE through D5 and D6

Navigation Plan:

To go from CH.1 to CH.2, we need to use two doors: D4 and D3. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(4)
2. OpenDoor(4)
3. GoThrough(4)
4. ApproachDoor(3)
5. OpenDoor(3)
6. GoThrough(3)

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CH.1",
  "end": "CH.2",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from CH.1 to CH.2 using only the necessary doors and actions.
