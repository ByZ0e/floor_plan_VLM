Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the BUREAU to the BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER
D2: Connects CELLIER and PORCHE
D3: Connects PORCHE and HALL
D4: Connects HALL and WC
D5: Connects HALL and LINGERIE
D6: Connects HALL and BUREAU
D7: Connects HALL and BAINS
D8: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE PARENTS
D9: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
D10: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
D11: Connects CELLIER and HALL

Navigation Plan:
To go from the BUREAU to the BAINS, we need to use two doors: D6 and D7.

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in BUREAU
2. ApproachDoor(6)
3. OpenDoor(6)
4. GoThrough(6) - Now in HALL
5. ApproachDoor(7)
6. OpenDoor(7)
7. GoThrough(7) - Now in BAINS

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "BUREAU",
  "end": "BAINS",
  "actions": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from the BUREAU to the BAINS, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
