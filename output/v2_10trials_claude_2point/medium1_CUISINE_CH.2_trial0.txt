Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. Let me first list out the rooms and doors with their connections based on the image:

Room and Door Connections:
1. CUISINE connects to SEJOUR through D3
2. CUISINE connects to WC through D8
3. SEJOUR connects to PORCHE through D1
4. SEJOUR connects to CELLIER through D2
5. SEJOUR connects to CH.1 through D4
6. CH.1 connects to DEGT through D5
7. CH.2 connects to DEGT through D6
8. DEGT connects to BAINS through D7

Now, let's create a step-by-step navigation plan from CUISINE to CH.2:

1. Start in CUISINE
2. ApproachDoor(D3)
3. OpenDoor(D3)
4. GoThrough(D3) to enter SEJOUR
5. ApproachDoor(D4)
6. OpenDoor(D4)
7. GoThrough(D4) to enter CH.1
8. ApproachDoor(D5)
9. OpenDoor(D5)
10. GoThrough(D5) to enter DEGT
11. ApproachDoor(D6)
12. OpenDoor(D6)
13. GoThrough(D6) to enter CH.2

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CUISINE",
  "end": "CH.2",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"}
  ]
}
```

This path takes you from the CUISINE to CH.2 using the most direct route based on the door connections provided in the floor plan.
