Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from CH.1 to the GARAGE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CH.1 connects to Hall through D2
2. CH.2 connects to Hall through D3
3. BAINS connects to Hall through D1
4. GARAGE connects to Hall through D4
5. CUISINE connects to Hall through D5

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
1. Start in CH.1
2. Approach and go through D2 to enter the Hall
3. In the Hall, approach and go through D4 to enter the GARAGE

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from CH.1 to the GARAGE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
