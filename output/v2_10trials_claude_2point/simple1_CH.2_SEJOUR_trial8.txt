Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from CH.2 to SEJOUR.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects CH.3 to SEJOUR
2. D2 connects CH.2 to CH.3
3. D3 connects CH.2 to SEJOUR
4. D4 connects CH.1 to SEJOUR
5. D5 connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
6. D6 connects SEJOUR to CUISINE

Now, let's create the navigation plan from CH.2 to SEJOUR:

Step-by-step solution:
1. We start in CH.2
2. The most direct route is to use D3, which connects CH.2 directly to SEJOUR

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from CH.2 to SEJOUR using only the necessary doors and actions.
