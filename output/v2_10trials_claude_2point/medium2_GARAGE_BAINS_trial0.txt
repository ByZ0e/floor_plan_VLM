Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the room and door connections, then provide a navigation plan from the GARAGE to the BAINS.

Explicit Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects GARAGE to HALL
D2: Connects CHAMBRE1 to HALL
D3: Connects HALL to WC
D4: Connects HALL to BAINS
D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE3
D6: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE2
D7: Connects CELLIER to HALL
D8: Connects HALL to Porche

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in GARAGE
2. ApproachDoor(D1)
3. OpenDoor(D1)
4. GoThrough(D1) to enter HALL
5. ApproachDoor(D4)
6. OpenDoor(D4)
7. GoThrough(D4) to enter BAINS

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from the GARAGE to the BAINS, using only the necessary doors (D1 and D4) and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
