Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects SEJOUR to PORCHE
- D2: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
- D3: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
- D4: Connects SEJOUR to DEGT
- D5: Connects CH.1 to DEGT
- D6: Connects CH.2 to DEGT
- D7: Connects BAINS to DEGT
- D8: Connects WC to DEGT

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in DEGT
2. Approach and open D4
3. Go through D4 to enter SEJOUR
4. Approach and open D1
5. Go through D1 to reach PORCHE

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from DEGT to PORCHE using only the necessary doors. The robot will start in DEGT, go through D4 to enter SEJOUR, and then through D1 to reach PORCHE. Each action is necessary and correct for traversal to the end goal, and no unnecessary doors or rooms are included in the path.
