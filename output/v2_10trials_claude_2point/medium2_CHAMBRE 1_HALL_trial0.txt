Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from CHAMBRE 1 to HALL.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects GARAGE to HALL
- D2: Connects CHAMBRE 1 to HALL
- D3: Connects CHAMBRE 1 to HALL (near WC)
- D4: Connects BAINS to HALL
- D5: Connects CHAMBRE 3 to HALL
- D6: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to HALL
- D7: Connects CELLIER to HALL
- D8: Connects HALL to Porche

Step-by-step solution:
Starting in CHAMBRE 1, we need to reach the HALL. There are two doors connecting CHAMBRE 1 to HALL: D2 and D3. We'll use D2 as it appears to be the most direct route.

1. ApproachDoor(D2)
2. OpenDoor(D2)
3. GoThrough(D2)

After these steps, we will be in the HALL, which is our destination.

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CHAMBRE 1",
  "end": "HALL",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from CHAMBRE 1 to HALL using only the necessary doors and actions.
