Certainly! I'll analyze the floor plan, provide explicit room and door connections, and then create a navigation plan for you to move from CH.1 to CH.2.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

1. CH.1 is connected to SEJOUR through D4
2. SEJOUR is connected to CH.2 through D3
3. SEJOUR is connected to CUISINE through D6
4. SEJOUR is connected to CH.3 through D1
5. CH.2 is connected to CH.3 through D2
6. CUISINE is connected to SEJOUR through D5

Now, let's create the navigation plan to go from CH.1 to CH.2:

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CH.1
2. Use D4 to enter SEJOUR
3. From SEJOUR, use D3 to enter CH.2

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CH.1",
  "end": "CH.2",
  "actions": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from CH.1 to CH.2, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
