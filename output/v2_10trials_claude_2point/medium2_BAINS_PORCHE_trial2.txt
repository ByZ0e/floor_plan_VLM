Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects Garage and Hall
- D2: Connects Chambre 1 and Hall
- D3: Connects Hall and WC
- D4: Connects Hall and Bains
- D5: Connects Hall and Chambre 3
- D6: Connects Hall and Chambre 2
- D7: Connects Hall and Cellier
- D8: Connects Hall and Porche

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
1. Start in Bains
2. ApproachDoor(D4)
3. OpenDoor(D4)
4. GoThrough(D4) to enter Hall
5. ApproachDoor(D8)
6. OpenDoor(D8)
7. GoThrough(D8) to reach Porche

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from the Bains to the Porche, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or actions.
