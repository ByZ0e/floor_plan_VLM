Thank you for providing the floor plan image and the navigation task. Let me first describe the rooms and doors with their connections based on the image:

Room and Door Connections:
1. CUISINE connects to SEJOUR through D5
2. SEJOUR connects to CH.2 through D3
3. SEJOUR connects to CH.1 through D4
4. SEJOUR connects to CH.3 through D2
5. CH.3 connects to another SEJOUR through D1

Now, I'll provide a step-by-step navigation plan from CUISINE to CH.3:

1. Start in CUISINE
2. ApproachDoor(D5)
3. OpenDoor(D5)
4. GoThrough(D5) to enter SEJOUR
5. ApproachDoor(D2)
6. OpenDoor(D2)
7. GoThrough(D2) to enter CH.3

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CUISINE",
  "end": "CH.3",
  "steps": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from the CUISINE to CH.3, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
