Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from CH.3 to CH.1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects CH.3 and SEJOUR (left side)
2. D2 connects CH.2 and SEJOUR (left side)
3. D3 connects CH.2 and SEJOUR (middle)
4. D4 connects CH.1 and SEJOUR (right side)
5. D5 connects CUISINE and SEJOUR (bottom right)
6. D6 connects CUISINE and SEJOUR (bottom)

Now, let's create the navigation plan to go from CH.3 to CH.1:

Step 1: Exit CH.3 to enter the left SEJOUR
Step 2: Cross the SEJOUR to reach CH.1

Here's the detailed action plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "doorNumber": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "doorNumber": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "doorNumber": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "doorNumber": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "doorNumber": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "doorNumber": 4
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates you from CH.3 to CH.1 using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
