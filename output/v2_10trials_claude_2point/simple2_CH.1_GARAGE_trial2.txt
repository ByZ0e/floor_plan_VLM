Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms, doors, and their connections, then provide a navigation plan from CH.1 to the GARAGE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CH.1 connects to the hall via D2
2. CH.2 connects to the hall via D3
3. BAINS connects to the hall via D1
4. GARAGE connects to the hall via D4
5. CUISINE connects to the hall via D5

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in CH.1
2. Approach and open D2 to enter the hall
3. Move through the hall towards D4
4. Approach and open D4 to enter the GARAGE

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from CH.1 to the GARAGE using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
