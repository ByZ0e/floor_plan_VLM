Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a detailed navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects Cellier to Hall
D2: Connects Hall to Bains
D3: Connects Hall to WC
D4: Connects Hall to Chambre 1
D5: Connects Hall to Chambre 2
D6: Connects Hall to Porche
D7: Connects Hall to Cuisine
D8: Connects Cuisine to Terrasse Couverte
D9: Connects Cellier to Garage

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in Garage
2. Use D9 to enter Cellier
3. Use D1 to enter Hall
4. Use D5 to enter Chambre 2

Based on these connections and the step-by-step solution, here's the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 9
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 9
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 9
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 5
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 5
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 5
    }
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan provides the most efficient path from the Garage to Chambre 2, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
