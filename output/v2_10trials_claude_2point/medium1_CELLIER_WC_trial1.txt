Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. Let me start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections based on the image:

Room and Door Connections:
- CELLIER: connected to CUISINE via D2
- CUISINE: connected to CELLIER via D2, to SEJOUR via D3
- SEJOUR: connected to CUISINE via D3, to PORCHE via D1, to DEGT via D4
- PORCHE: connected to SEJOUR via D1
- DEGT (Dégagement/Hallway): connected to SEJOUR via D4, to CH.2 via D6, to BAINS via D7, to WC via D8
- CH.1: connected to DEGT via D5
- CH.2: connected to DEGT via D6
- BAINS: connected to DEGT via D7
- WC: connected to DEGT via D8

Now, let's create a step-by-step navigation plan to get from the CELLIER to the WC:

1. ApproachDoor(2)
2. OpenDoor(2)
3. GoThrough(2)
4. ApproachDoor(3)
5. OpenDoor(3)
6. GoThrough(3)
7. ApproachDoor(4)
8. OpenDoor(4)
9. GoThrough(4)
10. ApproachDoor(8)
11. OpenDoor(8)
12. GoThrough(8)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8}
  ]
}
```

This path takes you from the CELLIER through the CUISINE and SEJOUR, into the DEGT (hallway), and finally to the WC. It uses only the necessary doors and avoids any unnecessary rooms or detours.
