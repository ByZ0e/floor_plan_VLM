Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms, doors, and their connections, then provide a navigation plan from the GARAGE to the BAINS.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects GARAGE to HALL
D2: Connects CHAMBRE1 to HALL
D3: Connects HALL to WC
D4: Connects HALL to BAINS
D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE3
D6: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE2
D7: Connects CELLIER to HALL
D8: Connects HALL to Porche

Step-by-step navigation plan:

1. Start in the GARAGE
2. ApproachDoor(1)
3. OpenDoor(1)
4. GoThrough(1) to enter the HALL
5. ApproachDoor(4)
6. OpenDoor(4)
7. GoThrough(4) to enter the BAINS

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "GARAGE",
  "end": "BAINS",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the GARAGE to the BAINS using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
