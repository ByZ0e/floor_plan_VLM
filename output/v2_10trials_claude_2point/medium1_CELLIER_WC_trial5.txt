Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the CELLIER to the WC.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE via D2
2. CUISINE: Connected to CELLIER via D2, SEJOUR via D3
3. SEJOUR: Connected to CUISINE via D3, PORCHE via D1, DEGT via D4
4. PORCHE: Connected to SEJOUR via D1
5. DEGT: Connected to SEJOUR via D4, CH.2 via D6, BAINS via D7, WC via D8
6. CH.1: Connected to DEGT via D5
7. CH.2: Connected to DEGT via D6
8. BAINS: Connected to DEGT via D7
9. WC: Connected to DEGT via D8

Navigation Plan:
To go from CELLIER to WC, we need to follow this path: CELLIER -> CUISINE -> SEJOUR -> DEGT -> WC

Here's the step-by-step navigation plan:

1. ApproachDoor(2)
2. OpenDoor(2)
3. GoThrough(2)
4. ApproachDoor(3)
5. OpenDoor(3)
6. GoThrough(3)
7. ApproachDoor(4)
8. OpenDoor(4)
9. GoThrough(4)
10. ApproachDoor(8)
11. OpenDoor(8)
12. GoThrough(8)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the CELLIER to the WC using only the necessary doors and rooms.
