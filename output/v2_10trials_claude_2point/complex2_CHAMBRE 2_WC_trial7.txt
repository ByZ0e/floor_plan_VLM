Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from CHAMBRE 2 to WC.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
- D2: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to HALL
- D3: Connects HALL to BAINS
- D4: Connects HALL to WC
- D5: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to HALL (near PORCHE)
- D6: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
- D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE
- D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
- D9: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in CHAMBRE 2
2. Approach and open D2 to enter the HALL
3. In the HALL, approach and open D4 to reach the WC

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CHAMBRE 2",
  "end": "WC",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from CHAMBRE 2 to WC, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
