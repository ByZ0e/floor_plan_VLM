Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms, doors, and connections, then provide a navigation plan from the WC to CHAMBRE 2.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

1. WC connects to HALL through D3
2. HALL connects to CHAMBRE 1 through D2
3. HALL connects to CHAMBRE 3 through D5
4. HALL connects to CHAMBRE 2 through D6
5. HALL connects to CELLIER through D7
6. HALL connects to Porche through D8
7. GARAGE connects to CELLIER through D1
8. BAINS connects to HALL through D4

Step-by-step navigation plan:

1. Start in WC
2. ApproachDoor(D3)
3. OpenDoor(D3)
4. GoThrough(D3) to enter HALL
5. ApproachDoor(D6)
6. OpenDoor(D6)
7. GoThrough(D6) to enter CHAMBRE 2

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "WC",
  "end": "CHAMBRE 2",
  "actions": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from the WC to CHAMBRE 2, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or actions.
