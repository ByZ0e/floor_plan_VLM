Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the GARAGE to the BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D9: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER
2. D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
3. D2: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to HALL
4. D5: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to PORCHE
5. D7: Connects CUISINE to HALL
6. D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
7. D6: Connects CHAMBRE 1 to HALL
4. D3: Connects HALL to BAINS
5. D4: Connects HALL to WC

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in the GARAGE
2. Approach and go through D9 to enter the CELLIER
3. Approach and go through D1 to enter the HALL
4. Approach and go through D3 to reach the BAINS

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the GARAGE to the BAINS, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
