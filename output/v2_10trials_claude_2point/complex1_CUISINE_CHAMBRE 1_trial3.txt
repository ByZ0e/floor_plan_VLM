Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the CUISINE to CHAMBRE 1.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects CELLIER and HALL
D2: Connects BAINS and HALL
D3: Connects WC and HALL
D4: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 1
D5: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 2
D6: Connects HALL and PORCHE
D7: Connects HALL and CUISINE
D8: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Connects CELLIER and GARAGE

Navigation Plan:
To go from CUISINE to CHAMBRE 1, we need to use two doors: D7 and D4. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(7)
2. OpenDoor(7)
3. GoThrough(7)
4. ApproachDoor(4)
5. OpenDoor(4)
6. GoThrough(4)

This plan takes you from the CUISINE through the HALL and into CHAMBRE 1 using the most direct route.

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CUISINE",
  "end": "CHAMBRE 1",
  "steps": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan ensures you navigate efficiently from the CUISINE to CHAMBRE 1 using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
