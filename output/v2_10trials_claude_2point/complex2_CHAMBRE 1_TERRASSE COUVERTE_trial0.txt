Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from CHAMBRE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
- D2: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to HALL
- D3: Connects BAINS to HALL
- D4: Connects WC to HALL
- D5: Connects PORCHE to HALL
- D6: Connects CHAMBRE 1 to HALL
- D7: Connects CUISINE to HALL
- D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
- D9: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER

Navigation Plan:
Starting from CHAMBRE 1, we need to go through the HALL and CUISINE to reach TERRASSE COUVERTE. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(D6)
2. OpenDoor(D6)
3. GoThrough(D6)
4. ApproachDoor(D7)
5. OpenDoor(D7)
6. GoThrough(D7)
7. ApproachDoor(D8)
8. OpenDoor(D8)
9. GoThrough(D8)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CHAMBRE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
