Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms, doors, and connections, then provide a navigation plan from the GARAGE to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER
- D2: Connects CELLIER to PORCHE
- D3: Connects PORCHE to HALL
- D4: Connects HALL to WC
- D5: Connects HALL to LINGERIE
- D6: Connects HALL to BUREAU
- D7: Connects HALL to BAINS
- D8: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE PARENTS
- D9: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
- D10: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
- D11: Connects CELLIER to HALL

Navigation Plan:
1. Start in GARAGE
2. ApproachDoor(D1)
3. OpenDoor(D1)
4. GoThrough(D1) to enter CELLIER
5. ApproachDoor(D11)
6. OpenDoor(D11)
7. GoThrough(D11) to enter HALL
8. ApproachDoor(D10)
9. OpenDoor(D10)
10. GoThrough(D10) to enter CHAMBRE ENFANT 1

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "GARAGE",
  "end": "CHAMBRE ENFANT 1",
  "actions": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D10"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from the GARAGE to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
