Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the CELLIER to CHAMBRE 3.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects GARAGE and HALL
2. D2 connects CHAMBRE 1 and HALL
3. D3 connects HALL and WC
4. D4 connects HALL and BAINS
5. D5 connects HALL and CHAMBRE 3
6. D6 connects HALL and CHAMBRE 2
7. D7 connects CELLIER and HALL
8. D8 connects HALL and Porche

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in CELLIER
2. Use D7 to enter HALL
3. Use D5 to enter CHAMBRE 3

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "doorNumber": 7
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "doorNumber": 7
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "doorNumber": 7
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "doorNumber": 5
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "doorNumber": 5
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "doorNumber": 5
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from the CELLIER to CHAMBRE 3, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
