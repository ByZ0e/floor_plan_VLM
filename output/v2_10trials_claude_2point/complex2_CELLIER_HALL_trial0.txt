Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the CELLIER to the HALL.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
2. D2: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to HALL
3. D3: Connects HALL to BAINS
4. D4: Connects HALL to WC
5. D5: Connects HALL to PORCHE
6. D6: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
7. D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE
8. D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
9. D9: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER

Navigation Plan:
To go from CELLIER to HALL, we only need to use one door: D1.

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CELLIER
2. Approach D1
3. Open D1
4. Go through D1 to enter HALL

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CELLIER",
  "end": "HALL",
  "actions": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from CELLIER to HALL using only the necessary door (D1) and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
