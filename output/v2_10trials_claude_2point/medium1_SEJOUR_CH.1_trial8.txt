Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from SEJOUR to CH.1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects SEJOUR and Porche
2. D2 connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
3. D3 connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
4. D4 connects SEJOUR and DEGT
5. D5 connects CH.1 and DEGT
6. D6 connects CH.2 and DEGT
7. D7 connects BAINS and DEGT
8. D8 connects WC and DEGT

Now, let's create the navigation plan from SEJOUR to CH.1:

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in SEJOUR
2. Approach door D4
3. Open door D4
4. Go through door D4 to enter DEGT
5. Approach door D5
6. Open door D5
7. Go through door D5 to enter CH.1

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from SEJOUR to CH.1 using only the necessary doors and actions.
