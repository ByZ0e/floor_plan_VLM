Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from SEJOUR to CH.1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects SEJOUR and Porche
2. D2 connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
3. D3 connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
4. D4 connects SEJOUR and DEGT
5. D5 connects CH.1 and DEGT
6. D6 connects CH.2 and DEGT
7. D7 connects BAINS and DEGT
8. D8 connects WC and DEGT

Navigation Plan:
To go from SEJOUR to CH.1, we need to use doors D4 and D5. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(4)
2. OpenDoor(4)
3. GoThrough(4)
4. ApproachDoor(5)
5. OpenDoor(5)
6. GoThrough(5)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from SEJOUR to CH.1 using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
