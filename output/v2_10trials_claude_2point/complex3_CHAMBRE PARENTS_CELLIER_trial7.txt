Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from the CHAMBRE PARENTS to the CELLIER.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D8: Connects CHAMBRE PARENTS to HALL
2. D7: Connects HALL to BAINS
3. D6: Connects HALL to BUREAU
4. D5: Connects HALL to LINGERIE
5. D4: Connects HALL to WC
6. D3: Connects HALL to PORCHE
7. D2: Connects PORCHE to CELLIER
8. D1: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE
9. D11: Connects CELLIER to HALL
10. D9: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
11. D10: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in CHAMBRE PARENTS
2. ApproachDoor(D8)
3. OpenDoor(D8)
4. GoThrough(D8) to enter HALL
5. ApproachDoor(D3)
6. OpenDoor(D3)
7. GoThrough(D3) to enter PORCHE
8. ApproachDoor(D2)
9. OpenDoor(D2)
10. GoThrough(D2) to enter CELLIER

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CHAMBRE PARENTS",
  "end": "CELLIER",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from the CHAMBRE PARENTS to the CELLIER, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
