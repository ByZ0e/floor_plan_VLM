Certainly! I'll provide a detailed analysis of the floor plan, list the rooms and door connections, and then give you a step-by-step navigation plan from the WC to the CUISINE.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

Rooms:
- GARAGES (large area at the top)
- DOUCHE
- WC
- CELLIER
- CUISINE (two separate areas)
- CHAMBRE 1 (two separate areas)
- Multiple HALL areas connecting different rooms

Doors and their connections:
D1: Connects GARAGES to CELLIER
D2: Connects GARAGES to DOUCHE
D3: Connects CELLIER to CUISINE
D4: Connects WC to HALL
D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
D6: Connects HALL to CUISINE
D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE (second area)

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in the WC
2. Use D4 to exit the WC into the HALL
3. From the HALL, use D6 to enter the CUISINE

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 6
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 6
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 6
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the WC to the CUISINE, using only the necessary doors (D4 and D6) and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
