Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the PORCHE to the LINGERIE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects GARAGE/CELLIER to PORCHE
2. D2: Connects PORCHE to CELLIER
3. D3: Connects PORCHE to HALL
4. D4: Connects HALL to WC
5. D5: Connects HALL to LINGERIE
6. D6: Connects HALL to BUREAU
7. D7: Connects HALL to BAINS
8. D8: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE PARENTS
9. D9: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
10. D10: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
11. D11: Connects CELLIER to HALL

Navigation Plan:
Starting from the PORCHE, we need to go through the HALL to reach the LINGERIE. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(3)
2. OpenDoor(3)
3. GoThrough(3)
4. ApproachDoor(5)
5. OpenDoor(5)
6. GoThrough(5)

Now, let's present this plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "PORCHE",
  "end": "LINGERIE",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from the PORCHE to the LINGERIE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
