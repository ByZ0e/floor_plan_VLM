Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the room and door connections, then provide a navigation plan from the CELLIER to the HALL.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
D2: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to HALL
D3: Connects BAINS to HALL
D4: Connects WC to HALL
D5: Connects PORCHE to HALL
D6: Connects CHAMBRE 1 to HALL
D7: Connects CUISINE to HALL
D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in the CELLIER
2. Use D1 to enter the HALL

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from the CELLIER to the HALL, using only the necessary door (D1) to complete the navigation task.
