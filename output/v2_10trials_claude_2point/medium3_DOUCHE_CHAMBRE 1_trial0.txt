Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the room and door connections, then provide a navigation plan from the DOUCHE to CHAMBRE 1.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects GARAGES to CELLIER
D2: Connects DOUCHE to HALL
D3: Connects CELLIER to CUISINE
D4: Connects WC to HALL
D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
D6: Connects HALL to CUISINE
D7: Connects CUISINE to HALL

Now, let's create the navigation plan:

Step 1: Exit the DOUCHE
ApproachDoor(D2)
OpenDoor(D2)
GoThrough(D2)

Step 2: Navigate through the HALL to CHAMBRE 1
ApproachDoor(D5)
OpenDoor(D5)
GoThrough(D5)

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the DOUCHE to CHAMBRE 1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or actions.
