Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects CELLIER and HALL
- D2: Connects BAINS and HALL
- D3: Connects WC and HALL
- D4: Connects CHAMBRE 1 and HALL
- D5: Connects CHAMBRE 2 and HALL
- D6: Connects HALL and PORCHE
- D7: Connects HALL and CUISINE
- D8: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
- D9: Connects CELLIER and GARAGE

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
1. Start in CHAMBRE 1
2. ApproachDoor(D4)
3. OpenDoor(D4)
4. GoThrough(D4) to enter HALL
5. ApproachDoor(D7)
6. OpenDoor(D7)
7. GoThrough(D7) to enter CUISINE
8. ApproachDoor(D8)
9. OpenDoor(D8)
10. GoThrough(D8) to reach TERRASSE COUVERTE

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"}
  ]
}
```

This path takes you from CHAMBRE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE efficiently, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
