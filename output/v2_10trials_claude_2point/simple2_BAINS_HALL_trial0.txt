Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan from BAINS to HALL.

Room and Door Connections:
1. BAINS connects to HALL through D1
2. CH.1 connects to HALL through D2
3. CH.2 connects to HALL through D3
4. GARAGE connects to CUISINE through D4
5. CUISINE connects to HALL through D5

Navigation Plan:
To move from BAINS to HALL, we only need to use one door: D1.

Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(1)
2. OpenDoor(1)
3. GoThrough(1)

Now, let me provide this plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "BAINS",
  "end": "HALL",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from BAINS to HALL using the most direct route available based on the floor plan provided.
