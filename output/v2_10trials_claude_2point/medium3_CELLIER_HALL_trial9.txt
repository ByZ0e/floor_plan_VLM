Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and their door connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the CELLIER to the HALL.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:
1. CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE via D3
2. CUISINE: Connected to CELLIER via D3, connected to HALL via D6
3. GARAGES: Connected to HALL via D1
4. DOUCHE: Connected to HALL via D2
5. WC: Connected to HALL via D4
6. CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D5
7. HALL: Connected to GARAGES via D1, DOUCHE via D2, WC via D4, CHAMBRE 1 via D5, CUISINE via D6, and another CUISINE via D7

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CELLIER
2. Use D3 to go from CELLIER to CUISINE
3. Use D6 to go from CUISINE to HALL

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D3"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D3"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D3"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D6"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D6"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D6"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the CELLIER to the HALL using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
