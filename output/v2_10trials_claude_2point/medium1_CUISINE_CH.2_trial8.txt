Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms, doors, and their connections, then provide a navigation plan from the CUISINE to CH.2.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects SEJOUR to Porche
D2: Connects CUISINE to SEJOUR
D3: Connects CUISINE to SEJOUR
D4: Connects SEJOUR to DEGT
D5: Connects CH.1 to DEGT
D6: Connects CH.2 to DEGT
D7: Connects BAINS to DEGT
D8: Connects WC to DEGT

Step-by-step navigation plan:

1. Start in CUISINE
2. ApproachDoor(D3)
3. OpenDoor(D3)
4. GoThrough(D3) to enter SEJOUR
5. ApproachDoor(D4)
6. OpenDoor(D4)
7. GoThrough(D4) to enter DEGT
8. ApproachDoor(D6)
9. OpenDoor(D6)
10. GoThrough(D6) to enter CH.2

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CUISINE",
  "end": "CH.2",
  "actions": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the CUISINE to CH.2, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
