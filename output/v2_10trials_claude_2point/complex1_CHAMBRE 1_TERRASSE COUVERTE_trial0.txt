Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. Let's start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections based on the image:

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Cellier <-> Hall
2. D2: Bains <-> Hall
3. D3: WC <-> Hall
4. D4: Chambre 1 <-> Hall
5. D5: Chambre 2 <-> Hall
6. D6: Hall <-> Porche
7. D7: Hall <-> Cuisine
8. D8: Cuisine <-> Terrasse Couverte
9. D9: Cellier <-> Garage

Now, let's create the navigation plan to go from Chambre 1 to Terrasse Couverte:

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in Chambre 1
2. Use D4 to enter the Hall
3. Move through the Hall
4. Use D7 to enter the Cuisine
5. Use D8 to reach the Terrasse Couverte

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from Chambre 1 to Terrasse Couverte, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
