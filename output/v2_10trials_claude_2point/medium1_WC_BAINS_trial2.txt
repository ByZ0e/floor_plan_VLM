Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. Let's start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, and then I'll provide the navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
1. WC connects to DEGT through D8
2. DEGT connects to CH.2 through D6
3. DEGT connects to CH.1 through D5
4. DEGT connects to SEJOUR through D4
5. SEJOUR connects to CUISINE through D3
6. SEJOUR connects to another part of SEJOUR through D1
7. CUISINE connects to CELLIER through D2
8. BAINS connects to DEGT through D7

Now, let's create the navigation plan to go from WC to BAINS:

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in WC
2. Exit WC to DEGT through D8
3. From DEGT, go to BAINS through D7

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 8
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 8
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 8
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 7
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 7
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 7
    }
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan provides the most efficient path from the WC to the BAINS, using only the necessary doors (D8 and D7) and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
