Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the BUREAU to the BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER
D2: Connects CELLIER and PORCHE
D3: Connects PORCHE and HALL
D4: Connects HALL and WC
D5: Connects HALL and LINGERIE
D6: Connects HALL and BUREAU
D7: Connects HALL and BAINS
D8: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE PARENTS
D9: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
D10: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
D11: Connects CELLIER and HALL

Navigation Plan:
To go from the BUREAU to the BAINS, we need to use two doors: D6 and D7.

Here's the step-by-step navigation plan:

1. Start in the BUREAU
2. ApproachDoor(D6)
3. OpenDoor(D6)
4. GoThrough(D6)
5. ApproachDoor(D7)
6. OpenDoor(D7)
7. GoThrough(D7)

Now, I'll provide the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "BUREAU",
  "end": "BAINS",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan efficiently guides you from the BUREAU to the BAINS using only the necessary doors and actions.
