Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the CELLIER to the HALL.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects CELLIER to HALL
2. D2 connects CHAMBRE 2 to HALL
3. D3 connects HALL to BAINS
4. D4 connects HALL to WC
5. D5 connects PORCHE to HALL
6. D6 connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
7. D7 connects CUISINE to HALL
8. D8 connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
9. D9 connects GARAGE to CELLIER

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
1. Start in CELLIER
2. ApproachDoor(D1)
3. OpenDoor(D1)
4. GoThrough(D1)

This plan will take you from the CELLIER directly to the HALL using the most efficient path.

JSON format of the final path:
```json
{
  "start": "CELLIER",
  "end": "HALL",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan provides the most direct and efficient route from the CELLIER to the HALL, using only the necessary door (D1) to achieve the goal.
