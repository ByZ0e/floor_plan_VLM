Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the CUISINE to CH.2.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects SEJOUR and Porche
2. D2: Connects CUISINE and CELLIER
3. D3: Connects CUISINE and SEJOUR
4. D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
5. D5: Connects DEGT and CH.1
6. D6: Connects DEGT and CH.2
7. D7: Connects DEGT and BAINS
8. D8: Connects DEGT and WC

Navigation Plan:
Starting in CUISINE, we need to reach CH.2. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(3)
2. OpenDoor(3)
3. GoThrough(3)
4. ApproachDoor(4)
5. OpenDoor(4)
6. GoThrough(4)
7. ApproachDoor(6)
8. OpenDoor(6)
9. GoThrough(6)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CUISINE",
  "end": "CH.2",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6}
  ]
}
```

This path takes you from the CUISINE through the SEJOUR and DEGT to reach CH.2, using only the necessary doors along the way.
