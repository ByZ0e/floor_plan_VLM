Certainly! I'll analyze the floor plan, list the rooms and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the CELLIER to the HALL.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

1. D1 connects GARAGES to CELLIER
2. D2 connects GARAGES to DOUCHE
3. D3 connects CELLIER to CUISINE
4. D4 connects WC to HALL
5. D5 connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
6. D6 connects CUISINE to HALL
7. D7 connects CUISINE to HALL

Step-by-step navigation plan:

1. Start in CELLIER
2. Use D3 to go from CELLIER to CUISINE
3. Use D6 to go from CUISINE to HALL

Now, I'll provide the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 6
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 6
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 6
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the CELLIER to the HALL using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors. The robot will start in the CELLIER, go through D3 to enter the CUISINE, and then use D6 to reach the HALL, which is the final destination.
