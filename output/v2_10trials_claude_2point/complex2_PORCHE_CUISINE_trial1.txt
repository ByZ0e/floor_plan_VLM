Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the PORCHE to the CUISINE.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
D2: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to HALL
D3: Connects BAINS to HALL
D4: Connects WC to HALL
D5: Connects PORCHE to HALL
D6: Connects CHAMBRE 1 to HALL
D7: Connects CUISINE to HALL
D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER

Navigation Plan:
To go from PORCHE to CUISINE, we need to use two doors: D5 and D7. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(5)
2. OpenDoor(5)
3. GoThrough(5)
4. ApproachDoor(7)
5. OpenDoor(7)
6. GoThrough(7)

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "PORCHE",
  "end": "CUISINE",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from the PORCHE to the CUISINE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
