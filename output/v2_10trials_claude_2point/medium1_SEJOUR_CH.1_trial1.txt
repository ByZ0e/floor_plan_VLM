Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms, doors, and their connections, then provide a navigation plan from SEJOUR to CH.1.

Room and Door Connections:
- SEJOUR connects to CUISINE via D1 and D3
- SEJOUR connects to CH.1 via D4
- SEJOUR connects to DEGT via D4
- CUISINE connects to CELLIER via D2
- DEGT connects to CH.1 via D5
- DEGT connects to CH.2 via D6
- DEGT connects to BAINS via D7
- DEGT connects to WC via D8

Navigation Plan:
To go from SEJOUR to CH.1, we only need to use one door: D4.

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in SEJOUR
2. Approach door D4
3. Open door D4
4. Go through door D4 to enter CH.1

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from SEJOUR to CH.1 using only the necessary doors and actions.
