Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and door connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from the CUISINE to CH.1.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects BAINS to HALL
- D2: Connects CH.1 to HALL
- D3: Connects CH.2 to HALL
- D4: Connects GARAGE to CUISINE
- D5: Connects CUISINE to HALL

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
1. Start in CUISINE
2. ApproachDoor(D5)
3. OpenDoor(D5)
4. GoThrough(D5) to enter HALL
5. ApproachDoor(D2)
6. OpenDoor(D2)
7. GoThrough(D2) to enter CH.1

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CUISINE",
  "end": "CH.1",
  "actions": [
    "ApproachDoor(D5)",
    "OpenDoor(D5)",
    "GoThrough(D5)",
    "ApproachDoor(D2)",
    "OpenDoor(D2)",
    "GoThrough(D2)"
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the CUISINE to CH.1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
