Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the CHAMBRE PARENTS to the CELLIER.

Room and Door Connections:
- D8: Connects CHAMBRE PARENTS to HALL
- D7: Connects HALL to BAINS
- D6: Connects HALL to BUREAU
- D5: Connects HALL to LINGERIE
- D4: Connects HALL to WC
- D3: Connects HALL to PORCHE
- D2: Connects PORCHE to CELLIER
- D1: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE
- D9: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
- D10: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
- D11: Connects HALL to CELLIER

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in CHAMBRE PARENTS
2. Use D8 to enter HALL
3. Use D11 to enter CELLIER

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 8
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 8
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 8
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 11
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 11
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 11
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from CHAMBRE PARENTS to CELLIER using the available doors. It avoids unnecessary detours and uses only the required doors to reach the destination.
