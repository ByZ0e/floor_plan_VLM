Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D8: Connects Chambre Parents to Hall
2. D7: Connects Hall to Bains
3. D6: Connects Hall to Bureau
4. D5: Connects Hall to Lingerie
5. D4: Connects Hall to WC
6. D3: Connects Hall to Porche
7. D2: Connects Porche to Cellier
8. D1: Connects Cellier to Garage
9. D11: Connects Cellier to Hall

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in Chambre Parents
2. Use D8 to enter the Hall
3. Move through the Hall
4. Use D3 to enter the Porche
5. Use D2 to enter the Cellier (destination reached)

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from Chambre Parents to Cellier using only the necessary doors.
