Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from DEGT to PORCHE.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects SEJOUR and PORCHE
D2: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
D3: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
D5: Connects CH.1 and DEGT
D6: Connects CH.2 and DEGT
D7: Connects BAINS and DEGT
D8: Connects WC and DEGT

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in DEGT
2. Use D4 to enter SEJOUR
3. Use D1 to reach PORCHE

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "DEGT",
  "goal": "PORCHE",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from DEGT to PORCHE using only the necessary doors. The robot will start in DEGT, go through D4 to enter SEJOUR, and then use D1 to reach the final destination, PORCHE.
