Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the connections and provide a navigation plan as requested.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER
D2: Connects PORCHE and CELLIER
D3: Connects PORCHE and HALL
D4: Connects HALL and WC
D5: Connects HALL and LINGERIE
D6: Connects HALL and BUREAU
D7: Connects HALL and BAINS
D8: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE PARENTS
D9: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
D10: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
D11: Connects CELLIER and HALL

Step-by-step solution:

1. Start in CHAMBRE PARENTS
2. Exit CHAMBRE PARENTS to HALL through D8
3. Move through HALL to CELLIER through D11

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 11}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CHAMBRE PARENTS to CELLIER using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
