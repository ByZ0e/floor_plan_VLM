Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from CHAMBRE 1 to the HALL.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects GARAGE to HALL
2. D2: Connects CHAMBRE 1 to HALL
3. D3: Connects CHAMBRE 1 to HALL (near WC)
4. D4: Connects BAINS to HALL
5. D5: Connects CHAMBRE 3 to HALL
6. D6: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to HALL
7. D7: Connects CELLIER to HALL
8. D8: Connects HALL to Porche

Step-by-step solution:
Starting in CHAMBRE 1, we need to reach the HALL. The most direct route is through door D2.

1. ApproachDoor(D2)
2. OpenDoor(D2)
3. GoThrough(D2)

Now, let's format this as a JSON plan:

```json
{
  "start": "CHAMBRE 1",
  "end": "HALL",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from CHAMBRE 1 to the HALL using only the necessary doors. The robot will approach door D2, open it, and go through it to reach the HALL directly from CHAMBRE 1.
