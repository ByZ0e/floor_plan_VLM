Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms, doors, and their connections, then provide a navigation plan from CH.1 to the GARAGE.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

Rooms:
- CH.1
- CH.2
- BAINS
- GARAGE
- CUISINE
- Multiple HALL areas connecting rooms

Doors and their connections:
D1: Connects CH.1 to HALL
D2: Connects CH.1 to HALL
D3: Connects CH.2 to HALL
D4: Connects GARAGE to CUISINE
D5: Connects CUISINE to HALL

Step-by-step navigation plan from CH.1 to GARAGE:
1. Start in CH.1
2. Use D2 to exit CH.1 and enter the HALL
3. Move through the HALL areas
4. Use D4 to enter the GARAGE from the CUISINE side

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 2
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 2
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 2
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 4
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from CH.1 to the GARAGE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
