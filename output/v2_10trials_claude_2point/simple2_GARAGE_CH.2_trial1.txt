Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from the GARAGE to CH.2.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects HALL to BAINS
- D2: Connects HALL to CH.1
- D3: Connects HALL to CH.2
- D4: Connects GARAGE to CUISINE
- D5: Connects HALL to CUISINE

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in the GARAGE
2. Approach and go through D4 to enter the CUISINE
3. From CUISINE, approach and go through D5 to enter the HALL
4. In the HALL, approach and go through D3 to reach CH.2

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the GARAGE to CH.2 using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
