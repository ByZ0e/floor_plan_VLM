Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll first list the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects SEJOUR and PORCHE
- D2: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
- D3: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
- D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
- D5: Connects CH.1 and DEGT
- D6: Connects CH.2 and DEGT
- D7: Connects BAINS and DEGT
- D8: Connects WC and DEGT

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
Starting from DEGT to reach PORCHE:

1. ApproachDoor(D4)
2. OpenDoor(D4)
3. GoThrough(D4)
4. ApproachDoor(D1)
5. OpenDoor(D1)
6. GoThrough(D1)

Now, I'll provide the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "DEGT",
  "end": "PORCHE",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan provides the most efficient route from DEGT to PORCHE using only the necessary doors. The robot will start in DEGT, go through D4 to enter SEJOUR, and then use D1 to reach PORCHE.
