Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. Let me first list out the rooms and doors with their connections based on the image, and then I'll provide the navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
2. D2: Connects HALL to BAINS
3. D3: Connects HALL to WC
4. D4: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
5. D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 2
6. D6: Connects HALL to PORCHE
7. D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE
8. D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
9. D9: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE

Navigation Plan:
To go from CELLIER to WC, we need to use doors D1 and D3. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(1)
2. OpenDoor(1)
3. GoThrough(1)
4. ApproachDoor(3)
5. OpenDoor(3)
6. GoThrough(3)

Now, let me provide this plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "doorNumber": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "doorNumber": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "doorNumber": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "doorNumber": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "doorNumber": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "doorNumber": 3}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the CELLIER to the WC using only the necessary doors. The robot will start in the CELLIER, go through D1 to enter the HALL, and then use D3 to reach the WC.
