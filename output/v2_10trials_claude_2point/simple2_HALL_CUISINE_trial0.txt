Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the HALL to the CUISINE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects HALL to BAINS
2. D2 connects HALL to CH.1
3. D3 connects HALL to CH.2
4. D4 connects HALL to GARAGE
5. D5 connects HALL to CUISINE

Based on these connections, here's the navigation plan to go from HALL to CUISINE:

1. We start in the HALL
2. ApproachDoor(5)
3. OpenDoor(5)
4. GoThrough(5)

Now, I'll provide this plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "HALL",
  "end": "CUISINE",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from the HALL to the CUISINE, using only the necessary door (D5) that connects these two areas directly.
