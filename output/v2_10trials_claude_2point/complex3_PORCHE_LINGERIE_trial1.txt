Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Explicit Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects Garage to Cellier
D2: Connects Porche to Cellier
D3: Connects Porche to Hall
D4: Connects Hall to WC
D5: Connects Hall to Lingerie
D6: Connects Hall to Bureau
D7: Connects Hall to Bains
D8: Connects Hall to Chambre Parents
D9: Connects Hall to Chambre Enfant 2
D10: Connects Hall to Chambre Enfant 1
D11: Connects Cellier to Hall

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in the Porche
2. Use D3 to enter the Hall
3. Use D5 to enter the Lingerie

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 5
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 5
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 5
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the Porche to the Lingerie using only the necessary doors and actions.
