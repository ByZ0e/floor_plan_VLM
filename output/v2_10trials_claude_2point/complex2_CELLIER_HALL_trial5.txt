Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the CELLIER to the HALL.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
2. D2: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to HALL
3. D3: Connects HALL to BAINS
4. D4: Connects HALL to WC
5. D5: Connects HALL to PORCHE
6. D6: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
7. D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE
8. D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
9. D9: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER

Navigation Plan:
To go from CELLIER to HALL, we only need to use one door: D1.

Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(1)
2. OpenDoor(1)
3. GoThrough(1)

Now, I'll provide the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CELLIER",
  "end": "HALL",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates you from the CELLIER to the HALL using the most direct route available based on the floor plan provided.
