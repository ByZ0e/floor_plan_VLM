Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from the GARAGE to CHAMBRE 2.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D9: Connects CELLIER and GARAGE
2. D1: Connects CELLIER and HALL
3. D2: Connects HALL and BAINS
4. D3: Connects HALL and WC
5. D4: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 1
6. D5: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 2
7. D6: Connects HALL and PORCHE
8. D7: Connects HALL and CUISINE
9. D8: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in GARAGE
2. ApproachDoor(D9)
3. OpenDoor(D9)
4. GoThrough(D9) to enter CELLIER
5. ApproachDoor(D1)
6. OpenDoor(D1)
7. GoThrough(D1) to enter HALL
8. ApproachDoor(D5)
9. OpenDoor(D5)
10. GoThrough(D5) to enter CHAMBRE 2

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the GARAGE to CHAMBRE 2, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
