Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from CH.1 to CH.2.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D4 connects CH.1 and SEJOUR
2. D3 connects SEJOUR and CH.2
3. D2 connects CH.2 and CH.3
4. D1 connects CH.3 and SEJOUR
5. D5 connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
6. D6 connects SEJOUR and CUISINE

Now, let's create the navigation plan from CH.1 to CH.2:

Step 1: Exit CH.1 to enter SEJOUR
- ApproachDoor(4)
- OpenDoor(4)
- GoThrough(4)

Step 2: Move from SEJOUR to CH.2
- ApproachDoor(3)
- OpenDoor(3)
- GoThrough(3)

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "doorNumber": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "doorNumber": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "doorNumber": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "doorNumber": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "doorNumber": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "doorNumber": 3
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from CH.1 to CH.2, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
