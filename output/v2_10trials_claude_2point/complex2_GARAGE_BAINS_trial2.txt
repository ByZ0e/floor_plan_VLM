Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from the GARAGE to the BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D9: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER
2. D1: Connects CELLIER and HALL
3. D2: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 2
4. D5: Connects HALL and PORCHE
5. D3: Connects HALL and BAINS
6. D4: Connects HALL and WC
7. D6: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 1
8. D7: Connects HALL and CUISINE
9. D8: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in GARAGE
2. ApproachDoor(D9)
3. OpenDoor(D9)
4. GoThrough(D9) to enter CELLIER
5. ApproachDoor(D1)
6. OpenDoor(D1)
7. GoThrough(D1) to enter HALL
8. ApproachDoor(D3)
9. OpenDoor(D3)
10. GoThrough(D3) to reach BAINS

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"}
  ]
}
```

This path efficiently navigates from the GARAGE to the BAINS using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
