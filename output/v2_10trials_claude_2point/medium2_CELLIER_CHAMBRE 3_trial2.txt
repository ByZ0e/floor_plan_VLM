Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects Garage and Hall
- D2: Connects Chambre 1 and Hall
- D3: Connects Hall and WC
- D4: Connects Hall and Bains
- D5: Connects Hall and Chambre 3
- D6: Connects Hall and Chambre 2
- D7: Connects Cellier and Hall
- D8: Connects Hall and Porche

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
Starting from Cellier to reach Chambre 3:

1. ApproachDoor(7)
2. OpenDoor(7)
3. GoThrough(7)
4. ApproachDoor(5)
5. OpenDoor(5)
6. GoThrough(5)

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "Cellier",
  "end": "Chambre 3",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the Cellier to Chambre 3, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
