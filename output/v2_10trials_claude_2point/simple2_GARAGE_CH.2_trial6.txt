Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the GARAGE to CH.2.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects BAINS to the small HALL near CH.1
2. D2 connects CH.1 to the small HALL near BAINS
3. D3 connects CH.2 to the HALL
4. D4 connects GARAGE to CUISINE
5. D5 connects CUISINE to the HALL

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in the GARAGE
2. Approach and go through D4 to enter CUISINE
3. Approach and go through D5 to enter the HALL
4. Navigate through the HALL to D3
5. Approach and go through D3 to enter CH.2

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the GARAGE to CH.2 using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
