Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the explicit room and door connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan from the BUREAU to the BAINS.

Explicit Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER
D2: Connects CELLIER and PORCHE
D3: Connects PORCHE and HALL
D4: Connects HALL and WC
D5: Connects LINGERIE and HALL
D6: Connects BUREAU and HALL
D7: Connects HALL and BAINS
D8: Connects CHAMBRE PARENTS and HALL
D9: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
D10: Connects CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 and HALL
D11: Connects CELLIER and HALL

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
1. Start in BUREAU
2. Use D6 to enter HALL
3. Use D7 to enter BAINS

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the BUREAU to the BAINS, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
