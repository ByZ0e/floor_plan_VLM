Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the CUISINE to CHAMBRE 1.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects CELLIER and HALL
D2: Connects BAINS and HALL
D3: Connects WC and HALL
D4: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 1
D5: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 2
D6: Connects HALL and PORCHE
D7: Connects HALL and CUISINE
D8: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Connects CELLIER and GARAGE

Navigation Plan:
Starting from CUISINE, we need to reach CHAMBRE 1. The most efficient path is:

1. Exit CUISINE to HALL through D7
2. From HALL, enter CHAMBRE 1 through D4

Here's the step-by-step navigation plan:

1. ApproachDoor(D7)
2. OpenDoor(D7)
3. GoThrough(D7)
4. ApproachDoor(D4)
5. OpenDoor(D4)
6. GoThrough(D4)

Now, I'll provide the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CUISINE",
  "end": "CHAMBRE 1",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan provides the most efficient route from CUISINE to CHAMBRE 1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
