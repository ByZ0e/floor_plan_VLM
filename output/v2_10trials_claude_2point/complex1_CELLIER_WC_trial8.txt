Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
2. D2: Connects HALL to BAINS
3. D3: Connects HALL to WC
4. D4: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
5. D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 2
6. D6: Connects HALL to PORCHE
7. D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE
8. D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
9. D9: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in CELLIER
2. Approach and go through D1 to enter HALL
3. From HALL, approach and go through D3 to reach WC

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D3"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D3"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D3"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from the CELLIER to the WC, using only the necessary doors (D1 and D3) and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
