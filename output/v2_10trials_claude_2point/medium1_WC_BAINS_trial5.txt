Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the WC to the BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D8 connects WC to DEGT
2. D7 connects DEGT to BAINS
3. D6 connects DEGT to CH.2
4. D5 connects DEGT to CH.1
5. D4 connects SEJOUR to DEGT
6. D3 connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
7. D2 connects CUISINE to CELLIER
8. D1 connects SEJOUR to Porche

Now, let's create the navigation plan from WC to BAINS:

Step 1: Exit WC through D8 to DEGT
Step 2: From DEGT, go through D7 to BAINS

Here's the JSON format of the navigation plan:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 8
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 8
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 8
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 7
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 7
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 7
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from the WC to the BAINS, using only the necessary doors (D8 and D7) and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
