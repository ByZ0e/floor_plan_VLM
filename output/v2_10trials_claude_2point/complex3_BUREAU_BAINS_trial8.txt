Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan from the BUREAU to the BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER
- D2: Connects CELLIER and PORCHE
- D3: Connects PORCHE and HALL
- D4: Connects HALL and WC
- D5: Connects LINGERIE and HALL
- D6: Connects BUREAU and HALL
- D7: Connects HALL and BAINS
- D8: Connects BAINS and CHAMBRE PARENTS
- D9: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
- D10: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
- D11: Connects CELLIER and HALL

Step-by-step navigation plan from BUREAU to BAINS:
1. ApproachDoor(6)
2. OpenDoor(6)
3. GoThrough(6)
4. ApproachDoor(7)
5. OpenDoor(7)
6. GoThrough(7)

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from the BUREAU to the BAINS, using only the necessary doors (D6 and D7) to reach the destination.
