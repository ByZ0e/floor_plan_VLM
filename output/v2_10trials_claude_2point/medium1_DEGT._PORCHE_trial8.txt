Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll start by listing the rooms and their door connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
1. DEGT: Connected to SEJOUR via D4, CH.2 via D6, and BAINS via D7
2. SEJOUR: Connected to DEGT via D4, CUISINE via D3, and another part of SEJOUR via D1
3. CUISINE: Connected to SEJOUR via D3, and CELLIER via D2
4. CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE via D2
5. PORCHE: Connected to SEJOUR via D1
6. CH.1: Connected to SEJOUR via D5
7. CH.2: Connected to DEGT via D6
8. BAINS: Connected to DEGT via D7
9. WC: Connected to DEGT via D8

Now, let's create the navigation plan to go from DEGT to PORCHE:

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in DEGT
2. Go to SEJOUR through D4
3. Go from SEJOUR to PORCHE through D1

JSON format navigation plan:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D1"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from DEGT to PORCHE using only the necessary doors. The robot will start in DEGT, go through D4 to enter SEJOUR, and then go through D1 to reach PORCHE.
