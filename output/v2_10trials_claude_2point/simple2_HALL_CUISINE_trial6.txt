Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the HALL to the CUISINE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects HALL to BAINS
2. D2 connects HALL to CH.1
3. D3 connects HALL to CH.2
4. D4 connects HALL to GARAGE
5. D5 connects HALL to CUISINE

Based on this analysis, here's the step-by-step navigation plan to go from HALL to CUISINE:

1. Start in the HALL
2. ApproachDoor(5)
3. OpenDoor(5)
4. GoThrough(5)

Now, I'll provide the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(5)",
    "OpenDoor(5)",
    "GoThrough(5)"
  ]
}
```

This is the most efficient path from the HALL to the CUISINE, using only the necessary door (D5) to reach the destination. The plan avoids any unnecessary doors or rooms, ensuring a direct route to the CUISINE.
