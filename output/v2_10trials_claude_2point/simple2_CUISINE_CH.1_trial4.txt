Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the CUISINE to CH.1.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects BAINS to HALL
D2: Connects CH.1 to HALL
D3: Connects CH.2 to HALL
D4: Connects GARAGE to CUISINE
D5: Connects CUISINE to HALL

Navigation Plan:
To go from CUISINE to CH.1, we need to use doors D5 and D2. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. Start in CUISINE
2. ApproachDoor(D5)
3. OpenDoor(D5)
4. GoThrough(D5) - Now in HALL
5. ApproachDoor(D2)
6. OpenDoor(D2)
7. GoThrough(D2) - Now in CH.1

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CUISINE",
  "end": "CH.1",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the CUISINE to CH.1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
