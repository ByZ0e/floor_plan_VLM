Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects BAINS to HALL
- D2: Connects CH.1 to HALL
- D3: Connects CH.2 to HALL
- D4: Connects GARAGE to CUISINE
- D5: Connects CUISINE to HALL

Step-by-step navigation plan:

1. Start in BAINS
2. Approach D1
3. Open D1
4. Go through D1 to enter HALL

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from BAINS to HALL, using only the necessary doors and actions. The robot will start in BAINS, approach door D1, open it, and go through to reach the HALL, which is the final destination.
