Certainly! I'll analyze the floor plan, list the room and door connections, and then provide a detailed navigation plan from the GARAGE to the BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects GARAGE to HALL
2. D2: Connects CHAMBRE1 to HALL
3. D3: Connects HALL to WC
4. D4: Connects HALL to BAINS
5. D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE3
6. D6: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE2
7. D7: Connects CELLIER to HALL
8. D8: Connects HALL to Porche

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in the GARAGE
2. ApproachDoor(1)
3. OpenDoor(1)
4. GoThrough(1) to enter the HALL
5. ApproachDoor(4)
6. OpenDoor(4)
7. GoThrough(4) to enter the BAINS

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "GARAGE",
  "end": "BAINS",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the GARAGE to the BAINS, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours. The robot will start in the GARAGE, go through door D1 to enter the HALL, and then use door D4 to reach the BAINS.
