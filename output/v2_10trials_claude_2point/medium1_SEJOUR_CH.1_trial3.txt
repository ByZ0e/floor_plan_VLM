Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the SEJOUR to CH.1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. SEJOUR connects to CUISINE through D1 and D3
2. SEJOUR connects to CH.1 through D4
3. SEJOUR connects to DEGT through D4
4. CUISINE connects to CELLIER through D2
5. DEGT connects to CH.1 through D5
6. DEGT connects to CH.2 through D6
7. DEGT connects to BAINS through D7
8. DEGT connects to WC through D8

Navigation Plan:
To move from SEJOUR to CH.1, we only need to use one door: D4. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(4)
2. OpenDoor(4)
3. GoThrough(4)

This sequence will take you directly from SEJOUR to CH.1.

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "SEJOUR",
  "end": "CH.1",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This is the most efficient path from SEJOUR to CH.1, using only the necessary door (D4) to reach the destination.
