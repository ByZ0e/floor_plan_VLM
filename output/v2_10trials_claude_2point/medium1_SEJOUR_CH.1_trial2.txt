Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from SEJOUR to CH.1.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects SEJOUR and Porche
- D2: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
- D3: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
- D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
- D5: Connects CH.1 and DEGT
- D6: Connects DEGT and CH.2
- D7: Connects DEGT and BAINS
- D8: Connects DEGT and WC

Step-by-step solution:
To navigate from SEJOUR to CH.1, we need to:
1. Go from SEJOUR to DEGT through D4
2. Go from DEGT to CH.1 through D5

Here's the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 5
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 5
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 5
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from SEJOUR to CH.1 using only the necessary doors (D4 and D5) without passing through any unnecessary rooms or doors.
