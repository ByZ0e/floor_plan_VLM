Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from CUISINE to CH.2.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects SEJOUR and Porche
D2: Connects CUISINE and CELLIER
D3: Connects CUISINE and SEJOUR
D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
D5: Connects DEGT and CH.1
D6: Connects DEGT and CH.2
D7: Connects DEGT and BAINS
D8: Connects DEGT and WC

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in CUISINE
2. Use D3 to enter SEJOUR
3. Use D4 to enter DEGT
4. Use D6 to reach CH.2

Now, I'll provide the detailed action plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from CUISINE to CH.2, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
