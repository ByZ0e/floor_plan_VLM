Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the WC to the BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D8 connects WC to DEGT
2. D7 connects DEGT to BAINS
3. D6 connects DEGT to CH.2
4. D5 connects CH.1 to DEGT
5. D4 connects SEJOUR to DEGT
6. D3 connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
7. D2 connects CUISINE to CELLIER
8. D1 connects SEJOUR to Porche

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in WC
2. Use D8 to enter DEGT
3. Use D7 to enter BAINS

Final Navigation Plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the WC to the BAINS, using only the necessary doors (D8 and D7) to reach the destination.
