Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the CUISINE to CH.1.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1 connects BAINS to HALL
- D2 connects CH.1 to HALL
- D3 connects CH.2 to HALL
- D4 connects GARAGE to CUISINE
- D5 connects CUISINE to HALL

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in CUISINE
2. Use D5 to enter HALL
3. From HALL, use D2 to enter CH.1

Now, I'll provide the detailed action sequence in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the CUISINE to CH.1 using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours or rooms.
