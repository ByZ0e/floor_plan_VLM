Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from CHAMBRE 1 to the HALL.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER
- D2: Connects CHAMBRE 1 to HALL
- D3: Connects HALL to WC
- D4: Connects HALL to BAINS
- D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 3
- D6: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 2
- D7: Connects CELLIER to HALL
- D8: Connects HALL to Porche

Navigation Plan:
To go from CHAMBRE 1 to HALL, we only need to use one door: D2.

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CHAMBRE 1
2. Approach D2
3. Open D2
4. Go through D2 to enter the HALL

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently takes you from CHAMBRE 1 to the HALL using only the necessary door (D2) without any unnecessary detours or actions.
