Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the room and door connections, then provide a navigation plan from the GARAGE to the BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D9: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER
2. D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
3. D2: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 2
4. D5: Connects HALL to PORCHE
5. D3: Connects HALL to BAINS
6. D4: Connects HALL to WC
7. D6: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
8. D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE
9. D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE

Step-by-step navigation plan from GARAGE to BAINS:
1. ApproachDoor(D9)
2. OpenDoor(D9)
3. GoThrough(D9)
4. ApproachDoor(D1)
5. OpenDoor(D1)
6. GoThrough(D1)
7. ApproachDoor(D3)
8. OpenDoor(D3)
9. GoThrough(D3)

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "GARAGE",
  "end": "BAINS",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"}
  ]
}
```

This path efficiently navigates from the GARAGE to the BAINS using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
