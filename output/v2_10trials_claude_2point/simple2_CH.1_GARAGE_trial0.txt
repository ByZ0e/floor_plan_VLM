Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan for you to move from CH.1 to the GARAGE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects CH.1 and HALL
2. D2 connects CH.1 and CH.2
3. D3 connects CH.2 and HALL
4. D4 connects GARAGE and CUISINE
5. D5 connects CUISINE and HALL

Now, let's create a step-by-step navigation plan:

1. Start in CH.1
2. Use D1 to enter the HALL
3. Move through the HALL
4. Use D4 to enter the GARAGE

Here's the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 4
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from CH.1 to the GARAGE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
