Certainly! I'll analyze the floor plan, list the room and door connections, and then provide a detailed navigation plan from the GARAGES to the CELLIER.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects GARAGES to CELLIER
2. D2: Connects GARAGES to DOUCHE
3. D3: Connects CELLIER to CUISINE
4. D4: Connects WC to HALL
5. D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
6. D6: Connects HALL to CUISINE
7. D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE (second instance)

Step-by-step Solution:
To navigate from GARAGES to CELLIER, we only need to use one door: D1.

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the GARAGES to the CELLIER using the most direct path available. The robot will approach door D1, open it, and go through it to reach the CELLIER. No unnecessary doors or rooms are included in this path.
