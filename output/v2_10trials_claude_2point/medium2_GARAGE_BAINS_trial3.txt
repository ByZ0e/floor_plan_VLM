Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from the GARAGE to the BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects GARAGE to HALL
- D2: Connects CHAMBRE1 to HALL
- D3: Connects HALL to WC
- D4: Connects HALL to BAINS
- D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE3
- D6: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE2
- D7: Connects CELLIER to HALL
- D8: Connects HALL to Porche

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
1. Start in GARAGE
2. ApproachDoor(1)
3. OpenDoor(1)
4. GoThrough(1) - Now in HALL
5. ApproachDoor(4)
6. OpenDoor(4)
7. GoThrough(4) - Now in BAINS

JSON format of the final path:
```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This path takes you directly from the GARAGE to the BAINS using only the necessary doors (D1 and D4) and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
