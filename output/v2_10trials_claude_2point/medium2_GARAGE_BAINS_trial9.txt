Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan from the GARAGE to the BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects GARAGE to HALL
2. D2: Connects CHAMBRE1 to HALL
3. D3: Connects HALL to WC
4. D4: Connects HALL to BAINS
5. D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE3
6. D6: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE2
7. D7: Connects CELLIER to HALL
8. D8: Connects HALL to Porche

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in the GARAGE
2. ApproachDoor(1)
3. OpenDoor(1)
4. GoThrough(1) to enter the HALL
5. ApproachDoor(4)
6. OpenDoor(4)
7. GoThrough(4) to enter the BAINS

Now, I'll provide the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This path efficiently navigates from the GARAGE to the BAINS using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
