Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects CELLIER to GARAGES
D2: Connects HALL to DOUCHE
D3: Connects CELLIER to CUISINE
D4: Connects HALL to WC
D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
D6: Connects HALL to CUISINE
D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE

Now, for the navigation task from CELLIER to HALL:

The most efficient path is to use door D3 to go from CELLIER to CUISINE, and then use door D6 to go from CUISINE to HALL.

Here's the step-by-step navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 6
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 6
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 6
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the CELLIER to the HALL using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
