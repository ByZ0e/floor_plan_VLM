Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the room and door connections, then provide a navigation plan from SEJOUR to CH.1.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects SEJOUR to Porche
- D2: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
- D3: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
- D4: Connects SEJOUR to DEGT
- D5: Connects DEGT to CH.1
- D6: Connects DEGT to CH.2
- D7: Connects CUISINE to BAINS
- D8: Connects DEGT to BAINS

To navigate from SEJOUR to CH.1, we need to use the following doors: D4 and D5.

Here's the step-by-step navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "SEJOUR",
  "end": "CH.1",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from SEJOUR to CH.1 using only the necessary doors (D4 and D5) without passing through any unnecessary rooms or doors.
