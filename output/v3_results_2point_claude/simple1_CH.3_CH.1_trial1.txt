Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from CH.3 to CH.1.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

Rooms:
- CH.3
- CH.2
- CH.1
- SEJOUR (multiple instances)
- CUISINE

Doors and their connections:
D1: Connects CH.3 to SEJOUR
D2: Connects CH.3 to CH.2
D3: Connects CH.2 to SEJOUR
D4: Connects SEJOUR to CH.1
D5: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
D6: Connects SEJOUR to SEJOUR

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan from CH.3 to CH.1:

```json
{
  "start": "CH.3",
  "end": "CH.1",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
  ]
}
```

This path takes you from CH.3 to CH.2, then to the SEJOUR area, and finally to CH.1, using only the necessary doors along the way. It's the most efficient route based on the floor plan provided.
