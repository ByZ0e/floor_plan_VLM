Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the CELLIER to the WC.

Rooms and Doors Connections:
1. CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE via D2
2. CUISINE: Connected to CELLIER via D2, to SEJOUR via D3
3. SEJOUR: Connected to CUISINE via D3, to Porche via D1, to DEGT via D4
4. DEGT (Dégagement/Hallway): Connected to SEJOUR via D4, to CH.1 via D5, to CH.2 via D6, to BAINS via D7, to WC via D8
5. CH.1: Connected to DEGT via D5
6. CH.2: Connected to DEGT via D6
7. BAINS: Connected to DEGT via D7
8. WC: Connected to DEGT via D8
9. Porche: Connected to SEJOUR via D1

Navigation Plan from CELLIER to WC:
1. ApproachDoor(D2)
2. OpenDoor(D2)
3. GoThrough(D2)
4. ApproachDoor(D3)
5. OpenDoor(D3)
6. GoThrough(D3)
7. ApproachDoor(D4)
8. OpenDoor(D4)
9. GoThrough(D4)
10. ApproachDoor(D8)
11. OpenDoor(D8)
12. GoThrough(D8)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan will efficiently guide you from the CELLIER to the WC using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
