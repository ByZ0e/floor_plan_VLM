Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the GARAGE to the BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER
2. D2: Connects CHAMBRE1 to HALL
3. D3: Connects HALL to WC
4. D4: Connects HALL to BAINS
5. D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE3
6. D6: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE2
7. D7: Connects CELLIER to HALL
8. D8: Connects HALL to Porche

Navigation Plan:
To go from the GARAGE to the BAINS, we need to use the following sequence of actions:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This path takes you from the GARAGE through the CELLIER and HALL to reach the BAINS, using only the necessary doors along the way.
