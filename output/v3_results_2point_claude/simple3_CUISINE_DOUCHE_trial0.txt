Thank you for providing the floor plan. Let me analyze the rooms and doors, and then provide you with a navigation plan.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

Rooms:
1. CUISINE (multiple instances)
2. CELLIER (two instances)
3. TERRASSE COUVERTE
4. CH. PARENTS (two instances)
5. DOUCHE (two instances)

Doors and their connections:
D1: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
D2: Connects CUISINE to CELLIER
D3: Connects CUISINE to CH. PARENTS
D4: Connects CH. PARENTS to DOUCHE

Now, let's create a navigation plan to get from CUISINE to DOUCHE:

{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}

This navigation plan will efficiently guide you from the CUISINE to the DOUCHE using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours or rooms.
