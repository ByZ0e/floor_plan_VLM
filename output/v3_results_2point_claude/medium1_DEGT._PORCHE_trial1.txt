Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from DEGT to PORCHE.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects SEJOUR to PORCHE
D2: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
D3: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
D4: Connects SEJOUR to DEGT
D5: Connects DEGT to CH.1
D6: Connects DEGT to CH.2
D7: Connects CUISINE to BAINS
D8: Connects CUISINE to DEGT

Based on these connections, here's the navigation plan from DEGT to PORCHE:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from DEGT to PORCHE using the shortest path available. It involves going through the SEJOUR to reach the PORCHE, using only the necessary doors (D4 and D1) to complete the task.
