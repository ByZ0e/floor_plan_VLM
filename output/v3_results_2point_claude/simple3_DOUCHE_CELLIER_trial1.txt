Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the DOUCHE to the CELLIER.

Rooms and Doors with Connections:

1. DOUCHE: Connected to CUISINE via D4
2. CUISINE (large central area): Connected to DOUCHE via D4, to CELLIER via D2, and to TERRASSE COUVERTE via D1
3. TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE via D1
4. CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE via D2
5. CH. PARENTS: Connected to CUISINE via D3 (though not needed for this navigation)

Navigation Plan:

To go from DOUCHE to CELLIER, we need to pass through the CUISINE. Here's the step-by-step plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the DOUCHE to the CELLIER using only the necessary doors (D4 and D2) and passing through the CUISINE.
