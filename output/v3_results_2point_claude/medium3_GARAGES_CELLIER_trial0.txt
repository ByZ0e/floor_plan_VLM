Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan to get from the GARAGES to the CELLIER.

Room and Door Connections:
1. GARAGES connects to CELLIER via Door D1
2. CELLIER connects to CUISINE via Door D3
3. CELLIER connects to HALL (near WC) via Door D1
4. CUISINE connects to HALL (near WC) via Door D6
5. HALL (near WC) connects to WC via Door D4
6. HALL (near WC) connects to DOUCHE via Door D2
7. HALL (near WC) connects to CHAMBRE 1 via Door D5
8. CUISINE (lower part) connects to HALL (lower part) via Door D7

For the navigation task from GARAGES to CELLIER, here's the efficient path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

This path is the most direct and efficient route from the GARAGES to the CELLIER, using only the necessary door (D1) to reach the destination.
