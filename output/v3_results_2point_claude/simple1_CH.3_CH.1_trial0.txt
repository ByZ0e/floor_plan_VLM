Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first describe the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
- CH.3 connects to SEJOUR through D1
- CH.3 connects to CH.2 through D2
- CH.2 connects to SEJOUR through D3
- CH.1 connects to SEJOUR through D4
- CUISINE connects to SEJOUR through D5 and D6

Navigation Plan:
To go from CH.3 to CH.1, we need to traverse through the SEJOUR. Here's the detailed plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CH.3",
  "end": "CH.1",
  "steps": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CH.3 to CH.1 using only the necessary doors (D1 and D4) and avoiding any unnecessary detours through other rooms or doors.
