Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the CUISINE to CH.2.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects SEJOUR and Porche
- D2: Connects CUISINE and CELLIER
- D3: Connects CUISINE and SEJOUR
- D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
- D5: Connects DEGT and CH.1
- D6: Connects DEGT and CH.2
- D7: Connects DEGT and BAINS
- D8: Connects CUISINE and DEGT

Navigation Plan:
To go from CUISINE to CH.2, we need to use the following doors: D8 and D6.

Here's the step-by-step navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 8
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 8
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 8
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 6
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 6
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 6
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan takes you from the CUISINE through D8 into the DEGT (dégagement or hallway), and then through D6 into CH.2, which is your final destination. This is the most direct and efficient route based on the floor plan provided.
