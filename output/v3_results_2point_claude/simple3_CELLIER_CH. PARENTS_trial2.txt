Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and door connections, then provide a navigation plan based on those connections.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:
1. D1 connects TERRASSE COUVERTE to CUISINE
2. D2 connects CUISINE to CELLIER
3. D3 connects CUISINE to CH. PARENTS
4. D4 connects CH. PARENTS to DOUCHE

Now, for the navigation task from CELLIER to CH. PARENTS:

{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}

This plan efficiently navigates from the CELLIER to CH. PARENTS using the necessary doors (D2 and D3) without any unnecessary detours or actions.
