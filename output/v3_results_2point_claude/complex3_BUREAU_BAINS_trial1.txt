Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the room and door connections, then provide a navigation plan from the BUREAU to the BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER
D2: Connects CELLIER and PORCHE
D3: Connects PORCHE and HALL
D4: Connects HALL and WC
D5: Connects HALL and LINGERIE
D6: Connects HALL and BUREAU
D7: Connects HALL and BAINS
D8: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE PARENTS
D9: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
D10: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
D11: Connects CELLIER and HALL

Navigation Plan:
To go from the BUREAU to the BAINS, we need to use two doors: D6 and D7.

Here's the step-by-step navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 6
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 6
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 6
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 7
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 7
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 7
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the BUREAU to the BAINS using only the necessary doors and actions.
