Certainly! I'll analyze the floor plan, provide a list of room and door connections, and then create a detailed navigation plan from CHAMBRE PARENTS to CELLIER.

Room and Door Connections:

D1: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER
D2: Connects CELLIER and PORCHE
D3: Connects PORCHE and HALL
D4: Connects HALL and WC
D5: Connects HALL and BUREAU
D6: Connects HALL and BAINS
D7: Connects HALL and HALL (near CHAMBRE PARENTS)
D8: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE PARENTS
D9: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
D10: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
D11: Connects HALL and CELLIER

Navigation Plan:
To go from CHAMBRE PARENTS to CELLIER, we need to use the following sequence of actions:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 11}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CHAMBRE PARENTS to CELLIER using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours. The robot will exit the CHAMBRE PARENTS, move through the HALL, and directly enter the CELLIER.
