Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from CH. PARENTS to TERRASSE COUVERTE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
2. D2: Connects CUISINE to CELLIER
3. D3: Connects CUISINE to CH. PARENTS
4. D4: Connects CH. PARENTS to DOUCHE

Navigation Plan:
To get from CH. PARENTS to TERRASSE COUVERTE, we need to go through the CUISINE. Here's the step-by-step plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from CH. PARENTS to TERRASSE COUVERTE using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
