Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the CELLIER to the WC.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
D2: Connects HALL to WC
D3: Connects HALL to HALL (different sections)
D4: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 2
D6: Connects HALL to PORCHE
D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE
D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE

Navigation Plan:
To go from the CELLIER to the WC, we need to use doors D1 and D2. Here's the detailed plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 2
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 2
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 2
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the CELLIER to the WC using only the necessary doors. The robot will start in the CELLIER, go through door D1 to enter the HALL, and then use door D2 to enter the WC, completing the navigation task.
