Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the WC to the BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects SEJOUR to Porche
2. D2: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
3. D3: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
4. D4: Connects SEJOUR to DEGT
5. D5: Connects CH.1 to DEGT
6. D6: Connects CH.2 to DEGT
7. D7: Connects DEGT to BAINS
8. D8: Connects DEGT to WC

Navigation Plan:
To go from the WC to the BAINS, we need to use two doors: D8 and D7. Here's the detailed plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 8
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 8
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 8
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 7
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 7
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 7
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the WC to the BAINS using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
