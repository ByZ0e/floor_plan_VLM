Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the WC to the BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects SEJOUR to Porche
2. D2 connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
3. D3 connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
4. D4 connects SEJOUR to DEGT
5. D5 connects DEGT to CH.1
6. D6 connects DEGT to CH.2
7. D7 connects DEGT to BAINS
8. D8 connects CUISINE to BAINS

Based on these connections, here's the navigation plan from WC to BAINS:

{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8}
  ]
}

Explanation:
1. The WC is directly connected to the CUISINE, and there's no door between them.
2. From the CUISINE, we can directly access the BAINS through door D8.
3. We approach D8, open it, and go through to reach the BAINS.

This is the most efficient path from WC to BAINS based on the floor plan provided. It avoids unnecessary rooms and doors, using only the required door (D8) to reach the destination.
