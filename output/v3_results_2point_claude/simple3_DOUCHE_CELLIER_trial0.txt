Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms and doors, create a list of connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the DOUCHE to the CELLIER.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE and CUISINE
D2: Connects CUISINE and CELLIER
D3: Connects CUISINE and CH. PARENTS
D4: Connects CUISINE and DOUCHE

Now, let's create the navigation plan from DOUCHE to CELLIER:

{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2}
  ]
}

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the DOUCHE to the CELLIER using the necessary doors. The path goes through the CUISINE, which connects both the starting and ending points. The plan avoids unnecessary rooms and doors, providing a direct route to your destination.
