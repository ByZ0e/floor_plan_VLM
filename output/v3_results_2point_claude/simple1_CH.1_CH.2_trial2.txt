Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from CH.1 to CH.2.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CH.1 connects to SEJOUR through D4
2. CH.2 connects to SEJOUR through D3
3. CH.3 connects to SEJOUR through D2
4. CH.3 also connects to another SEJOUR area through D1
5. CUISINE connects to SEJOUR through D5 and D6

Navigation Plan:
To go from CH.1 to CH.2, we need to go through the SEJOUR area. Here's the step-by-step plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CH.1",
  "end": "CH.2",
  "actions": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CH.1 to CH.2 using only the necessary doors (D4 and D3) and passing through the SEJOUR area. It avoids unnecessary detours through other rooms or doors.
