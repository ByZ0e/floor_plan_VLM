Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from CHAMBRE 1 to GARAGES.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects GARAGES to CELLIER
D2: Connects HALL to DOUCHE
D3: Connects CELLIER to CUISINE
D4: Connects HALL to WC
D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
D6: Connects HALL to CUISINE
D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE (second instance)

Now, let's create the navigation plan from CHAMBRE 1 to GARAGES:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan will efficiently guide you from CHAMBRE 1 to GARAGES using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
