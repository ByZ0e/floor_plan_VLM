Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan from the CUISINE to CH.1.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects BAINS to HALL
- D2: Connects CH.1 to HALL
- D3: Connects CH.2 to HALL
- D4: Connects GARAGE to CUISINE
- D5: Connects CUISINE to HALL

Navigation Plan:
To get from CUISINE to CH.1, we need to go through the following sequence:
CUISINE -> D5 -> HALL -> D2 -> CH.1

Here's the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the CUISINE to CH.1 using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours. The robot will start in the CUISINE, go through door D5 to enter the HALL, and then use door D2 to enter CH.1, which is the final destination.
