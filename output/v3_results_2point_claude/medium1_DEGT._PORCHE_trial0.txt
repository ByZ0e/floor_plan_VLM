Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from DEGT to PORCHE.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects SEJOUR to PORCHE
D2: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
D3: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
D4: Connects SEJOUR to DEGT
D5: Connects DEGT to CH.1
D6: Connects DEGT to CH.2
D7: Connects CUISINE to BAINS
D8: Connects CUISINE to DEGT

Now, for the navigation plan from DEGT to PORCHE:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from DEGT to PORCHE using the shortest path available. Here's a breakdown of the steps:

1. Start in DEGT
2. Approach and go through D4 to enter SEJOUR
3. From SEJOUR, approach and go through D1 to reach PORCHE

This route avoids unnecessary rooms and uses only the doors required for the most direct path to the destination.
