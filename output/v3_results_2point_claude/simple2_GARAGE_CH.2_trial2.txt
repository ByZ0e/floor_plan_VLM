Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the GARAGE to CH.2.

Rooms and Doors:
1. GARAGE: Connected to CUISINE via D4
2. CUISINE: Connected to GARAGE via D4, and to HALL via D5
3. HALL: Connected to CUISINE via D5, to CH.2 via D3, and to BAINS via D2
4. CH.2: Connected to HALL via D3
5. BAINS: Connected to HALL via D2, and to CH.1 via D1
6. CH.1: Connected to BAINS via D1

Navigation Plan:
To go from the GARAGE to CH.2, we need to follow this path: GARAGE -> CUISINE -> HALL -> CH.2

Here's the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates you from the GARAGE to CH.2 using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
