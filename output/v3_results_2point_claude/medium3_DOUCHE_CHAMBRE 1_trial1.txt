Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the DOUCHE to CHAMBRE 1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects GARAGES to CELLIER
2. D2: Connects HALL to DOUCHE
3. D3: Connects CELLIER to CUISINE
4. D4: Connects HALL to WC
5. D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
6. D6: Connects HALL to CUISINE
7. D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE (second entrance)

Now, let's create the navigation plan from DOUCHE to CHAMBRE 1:

{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5}
  ]
}

This plan efficiently navigates from the DOUCHE to CHAMBRE 1 using the minimum number of necessary doors and actions. The robot starts in the DOUCHE, exits through D2 into the HALL, and then enters CHAMBRE 1 through D5.
