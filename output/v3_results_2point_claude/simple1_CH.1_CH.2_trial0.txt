Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
- CH.1 is connected to SEJOUR through D4
- CH.2 is connected to SEJOUR through D3
- CH.3 is connected to SEJOUR through D2
- CH.3 is also connected to another SEJOUR area through D1
- CUISINE is connected to SEJOUR through D5 and D6

Now, for the navigation plan from CH.1 to CH.2:

{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(D4)",
    "OpenDoor(D4)",
    "GoThrough(D4)",
    "ApproachDoor(D3)",
    "OpenDoor(D3)",
    "GoThrough(D3)"
  ]
}

This plan efficiently navigates from CH.1 to CH.2 using only the necessary doors. The robot starts in CH.1, goes through D4 to enter the SEJOUR area, and then uses D3 to reach CH.2.
