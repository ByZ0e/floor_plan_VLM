Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from CHAMBRE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
D2: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to HALL
D3: Connects HALL to BAINS
D4: Connects HALL to WC
D5: Connects HALL to PORCHE
D6: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE
D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER

Navigation Plan:
To get from CHAMBRE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE, we need to go through the following doors: D6, D7, and D8.

Here's the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently guide you from CHAMBRE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
