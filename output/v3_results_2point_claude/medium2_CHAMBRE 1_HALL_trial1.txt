Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the connections and provide a navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
- CHAMBRE 1 connects to HALL through D2
- HALL connects to CELLIER through D7
- HALL connects to Porche through D8
- HALL connects to WC through D3
- HALL connects to CHAMBRE 2 through D6
- HALL connects to CHAMBRE 3 through D5
- GARAGE connects to CELLIER through D1

For the navigation task from CHAMBRE 1 to HALL, here's the detailed plan:

{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D2"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D2"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D2"
    }
  ]
}

This plan efficiently navigates you from CHAMBRE 1 to HALL using the most direct path available. You'll approach door D2, open it, and go through it to enter the HALL area directly from CHAMBRE 1.
