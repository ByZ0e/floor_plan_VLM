Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the WC to the CUISINE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects GARAGES to CELLIER
2. D2 connects HALL to DOUCHE
3. D3 connects CELLIER to CUISINE
4. D4 connects WC to HALL
5. D5 connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
6. D6 connects HALL to CUISINE
7. D7 connects CUISINE to HALL

Navigation Plan:
To go from the WC to the CUISINE, we need to use doors D4 and D6. Here's the step-by-step plan:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the WC to the CUISINE using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
