Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan to get from the CUISINE to CH.3.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects SEJOUR to CH.3
2. D2 connects CH.3 to CH.2
3. D3 connects CH.2 to SEJOUR
4. D4 connects SEJOUR to CH.1
5. D5 connects CUISINE to SEJOUR
6. D6 connects SEJOUR to SEJOUR (appears to be an internal door within the larger SEJOUR area)

Now, let's create the navigation plan from CUISINE to CH.3:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the CUISINE to CH.3 using the necessary doors. It starts in the CUISINE, goes through D5 to enter the SEJOUR, and then uses D1 to enter CH.3, which is the final destination.
