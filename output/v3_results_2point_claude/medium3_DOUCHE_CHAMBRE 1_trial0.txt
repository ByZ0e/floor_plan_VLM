Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
- DOUCHE: Connected to HALL via D2
- HALL: Connected to WC via D4, CHAMBRE 1 via D5, CUISINE via D6
- CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D6, CELLIER via D3
- CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE via D3, GARAGES via D1
- GARAGES: Connected to CELLIER via D1
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D5
- WC: Connected to HALL via D4

Now, for the navigation plan from DOUCHE to CHAMBRE 1:

{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"}
  ]
}

This plan efficiently navigates from the DOUCHE to CHAMBRE 1 using only the necessary doors. The robot will exit the DOUCHE through D2 into the HALL, then proceed directly to CHAMBRE 1 through D5.
