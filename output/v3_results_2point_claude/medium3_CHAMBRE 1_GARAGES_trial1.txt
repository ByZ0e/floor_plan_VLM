Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms, doors, and their connections, then provide you with a navigation plan to get from CHAMBRE 1 to GARAGES.

Explicit Room and Door Connections:

D1: Connects GARAGES to CELLIER
D2: Connects HALL to DOUCHE
D3: Connects CELLIER to CUISINE
D4: Connects HALL to WC
D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
D6: Connects HALL to CUISINE
D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE (different section)

Step-by-step navigation plan:

1. Start in CHAMBRE 1
2. Use D5 to enter HALL
3. Use D6 to enter CUISINE
4. Use D3 to enter CELLIER
5. Use D1 to enter GARAGES

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CHAMBRE 1",
  "end": "GARAGES",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from CHAMBRE 1 to GARAGES, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
