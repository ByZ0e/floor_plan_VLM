Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from CH.1 to the GARAGE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects CH.1 to HALL
2. D2 connects CH.1 to HALL
3. D3 connects CH.2 to HALL
4. D4 connects HALL to GARAGE
5. D5 connects CUISINE to HALL

Now, let's create the navigation plan from CH.1 to GARAGE:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from CH.1 to the GARAGE. It uses the minimum number of necessary doors and avoids any unnecessary rooms or passages. The robot will exit CH.1 through D1, move through the HALL, and then enter the GARAGE through D4.
