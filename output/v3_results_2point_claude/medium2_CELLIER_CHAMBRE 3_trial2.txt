Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the CELLIER to CHAMBRE 3.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER
2. D2: Connects CHAMBRE 1 and HALL
3. D3: Connects HALL and WC
4. D4: Connects HALL and BAINS
5. D5: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 3
6. D6: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 2
7. D7: Connects CELLIER and HALL
8. D8: Connects HALL and Porche

Now, let's create the navigation plan from CELLIER to CHAMBRE 3:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the CELLIER to CHAMBRE 3 using the minimum number of necessary doors. The robot starts in the CELLIER, goes through D7 to enter the HALL, and then uses D5 to reach CHAMBRE 3. This is the most direct path based on the provided floor plan.
