Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from BAINS to PORCHE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER
2. D2: Connects CHAMBRE1 and HALL
3. D3: Connects BAINS and HALL
4. D4: Connects BAINS and HALL
5. D5: Connects CHAMBRE3 and HALL
6. D6: Connects CHAMBRE2 and HALL
7. D7: Connects CELLIER and HALL
8. D8: Connects HALL and PORCHE

Based on these connections, here's the efficient navigation plan from BAINS to PORCHE:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from BAINS to PORCHE using the minimum number of necessary doors. The robot starts in BAINS, exits through D4 into the HALL, and then goes through D8 to reach the PORCHE.
