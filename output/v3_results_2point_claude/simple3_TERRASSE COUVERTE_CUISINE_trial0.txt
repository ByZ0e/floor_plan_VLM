Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan to get from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to the CUISINE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. TERRASSE COUVERTE <-> D1 <-> CUISINE
2. CUISINE <-> D2 <-> CELLIER
3. CUISINE <-> D3 <-> CH. PARENTS
4. CH. PARENTS <-> D4 <-> DOUCHE

Now, for the navigation plan from TERRASSE COUVERTE to CUISINE:

{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}

This plan will efficiently take you from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to the CUISINE using the most direct path. You'll approach Door 1 (D1), open it, and go through it to enter the CUISINE. No other doors need to be used for this particular navigation task.
