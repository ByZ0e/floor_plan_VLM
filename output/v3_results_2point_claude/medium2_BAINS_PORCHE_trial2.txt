Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from BAINS to PORCHE.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER
- D2: Connects CHAMBRE1 and HALL
- D3: Connects BAINS and HALL
- D4: Connects BAINS and HALL
- D5: Connects CHAMBRE3 and HALL
- D6: Connects CHAMBRE2 and HALL
- D7: Connects CELLIER and HALL
- D8: Connects HALL and PORCHE

Now, for the navigation plan from BAINS to PORCHE:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from BAINS to PORCHE using only the necessary doors. The robot will exit the BAINS through D3 into the HALL, then proceed directly to D8 to reach the PORCHE. No unnecessary rooms or doors are included in this path.
