Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms and doors, create a list of connections, and then provide a navigation plan from CHAMBRE 2 to WC.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects CHAMBRE 2 and HALL
D2: Connects CHAMBRE 2 and HALL
D3: Connects HALL and BAINS
D4: Connects HALL and WC
D5: Connects HALL and PORCHE
D6: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 1
D7: Connects HALL and CUISINE
D8: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER

Navigation Plan:
To go from CHAMBRE 2 to WC, we need to use two doors: D2 and D4. Here's the detailed plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CHAMBRE 2",
  "end": "WC",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from CHAMBRE 2 to WC using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
