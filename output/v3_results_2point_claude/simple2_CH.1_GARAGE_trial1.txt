Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms, doors, and their connections, then provide you with a detailed navigation plan from CH.1 to the GARAGE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CH.1 connects to HALL via D2
2. CH.2 connects to HALL via D3
3. BAINS connects to HALL via D1
4. GARAGE connects to HALL via D4
5. CUISINE connects to HALL via D5

Now, let's create the navigation plan from CH.1 to GARAGE:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently guide you from CH.1 to the GARAGE using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours. The plan follows the correct path based on the room and door connections observed in the floor plan.
