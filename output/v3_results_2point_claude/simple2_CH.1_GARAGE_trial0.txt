Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms, doors, and their connections, then provide you with a navigation plan from CH.1 to the GARAGE.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

Doors:
D1: Connects CH.1 to HALL
D2: Connects HALL to BAINS
D3: Connects HALL to CH.2
D4: Connects HALL to GARAGE
D5: Connects HALL to CUISINE

Rooms and their connections:
CH.1: Connected to HALL via D1
HALL: Connected to CH.1 (D1), BAINS (D2), CH.2 (D3), GARAGE (D4), CUISINE (D5)
BAINS: Connected to HALL via D2
CH.2: Connected to HALL via D3
GARAGE: Connected to HALL via D4
CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D5

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan from CH.1 to GARAGE:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates you from CH.1 to the GARAGE using only the necessary doors. It avoids any unnecessary rooms or doors, providing a direct path to your destination.
