Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
- WC: Connected to Hall via D4
- Hall: Connected to WC (D4), Douche (D2), Chambre 1 (D5), Cuisine (D6)
- Douche: Connected to Hall via D2
- Chambre 1: Connected to Hall via D5
- Cuisine: Connected to Hall via D6, Cellier via D3
- Cellier: Connected to Cuisine via D3, Garages via D1
- Garages: Connected to Cellier via D1

Navigation Plan:
To go from WC to Cuisine, we need to:
1. Exit WC to Hall
2. Go from Hall to Cuisine

Here's the detailed action plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D6"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D6"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D6"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the WC to the Cuisine using only the necessary doors (D4 and D6) and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
