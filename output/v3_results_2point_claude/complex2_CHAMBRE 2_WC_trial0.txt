Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list the rooms and their door connections, then provide the navigation plan to get from CHAMBRE 2 to WC.

Room and Door Connections:
1. GARAGE - D9 connects to CELLIER
2. CELLIER - D9 connects to GARAGE, D1 connects to HALL
3. CHAMBRE 2 - D2 connects to HALL
4. HALL - D1 connects to CELLIER, D2 connects to CHAMBRE 2, D3 connects to BAINS, D4 connects to WC, D5 connects to PORCHE, D6 connects to CHAMBRE 1, D7 connects to CUISINE
5. BAINS - D3 connects to HALL
6. WC - D4 connects to HALL
7. PORCHE - D5 connects to HALL
8. CHAMBRE 1 - D6 connects to HALL
9. CUISINE - D7 connects to HALL, D8 connects to TERRASSE COUVERTE
10. TERRASSE COUVERTE - D8 connects to CUISINE

Navigation Plan from CHAMBRE 2 to WC:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CHAMBRE 2 to WC using only the necessary doors (D2 and D4) and passing through the HALL. The plan avoids any unnecessary detours or rooms, providing a direct path to the destination.
