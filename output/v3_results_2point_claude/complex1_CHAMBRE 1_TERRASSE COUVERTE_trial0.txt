Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from CHAMBRE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects CELLIER and HALL
- D2: Connects HALL and WC
- D3: Connects HALL and BAINS
- D4: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 1
- D5: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 2
- D6: Connects HALL and PORCHE
- D7: Connects HALL and CUISINE
- D8: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
- D9: Connects CELLIER and GARAGE

Navigation Plan:
To go from CHAMBRE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE, we need to use the following doors: D4, D7, and D8.

Here's the step-by-step navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from CHAMBRE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
