Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the WC to the CUISINE.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:
D1: Connects GARAGES to CELLIER
D2: Connects HALL to DOUCHE
D3: Connects CELLIER to CUISINE
D4: Connects WC to HALL
D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
D6: Connects HALL to CUISINE
D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE

Now, let's create the navigation plan from WC to CUISINE:

The most efficient path from WC to CUISINE is:
WC -> HALL -> CUISINE

Here's the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "doorNumber": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "doorNumber": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "doorNumber": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "doorNumber": 6
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "doorNumber": 6
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "doorNumber": 6
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the WC to the CUISINE using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
