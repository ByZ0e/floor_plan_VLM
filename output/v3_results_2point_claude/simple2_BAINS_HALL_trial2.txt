Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the connections and provide a navigation plan as requested.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects BAINS to HALL
D2: Connects CH.1 to HALL
D3: Connects CH.2 to HALL
D4: Connects GARAGE to CUISINE
D5: Connects CUISINE to HALL

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan to go from BAINS to HALL:

{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(1)",
    "OpenDoor(1)",
    "GoThrough(1)"
  ]
}

This navigation plan is the most efficient route from BAINS to HALL, using only the necessary door (D1) that directly connects these two areas. The plan avoids any unnecessary rooms or doors and provides the correct sequence of actions to reach the destination.
