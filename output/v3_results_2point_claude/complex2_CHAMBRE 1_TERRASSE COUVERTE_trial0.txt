Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to HALL
D2: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to HALL
D3: Connects HALL to BAINS
D4: Connects HALL to WC
D5: Connects HALL to PORCHE
D6: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE
D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER

Navigation Plan:
To go from CHAMBRE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE, the efficient path is:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8}
  ]
}
```

This plan takes you from CHAMBRE 1 through the HALL, into the CUISINE, and finally to the TERRASSE COUVERTE, using only the necessary doors along the most direct path.
