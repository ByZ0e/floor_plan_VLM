Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to the CUISINE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. TERRASSE COUVERTE <-> D1 <-> CUISINE
2. CUISINE <-> D2 <-> CELLIER
3. CH. PARENTS <-> D3 <-> CUISINE
4. CUISINE <-> D4 <-> DOUCHE

Based on these connections, here's the navigation plan to get from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to the CUISINE:

{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 1
    }
  ]
}

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to the CUISINE using the most direct path available. You'll approach Door 1 (D1), open it, and go through it to enter the CUISINE, which is your destination.
