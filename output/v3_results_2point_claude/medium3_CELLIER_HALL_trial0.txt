Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the CELLIER to the HALL.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects CELLIER to GARAGES
D2: Connects HALL to DOUCHE
D3: Connects CELLIER to CUISINE
D4: Connects HALL to WC
D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
D6: Connects HALL to CUISINE
D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE (different part of the HALL)

Now, for the navigation task from CELLIER to HALL, here's the step-by-step plan:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the CELLIER to the HALL using the necessary doors. It avoids any unnecessary detours through other rooms or unused doors. The robot will exit the CELLIER through door D3 into the CUISINE, then use door D6 to enter the HALL, completing the navigation task.
