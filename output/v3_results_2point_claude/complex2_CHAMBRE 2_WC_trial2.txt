Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to HALL
- D2: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to HALL
- D3: Connects HALL to BAINS
- D4: Connects HALL to WC
- D5: Connects HALL to PORCHE
- D6: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
- D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE
- D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
- D9: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER

Navigation Plan:
To go from CHAMBRE 2 to WC, we need to use doors D2 and D4. Here's the detailed plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CHAMBRE 2",
  "end": "WC",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CHAMBRE 2 to WC using only the necessary doors (D2 and D4) and avoiding any unnecessary detours through other rooms or doors.
