Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan from CHAMBRE PARENTS to CELLIER.

Room and Door Connections:
D8: Connects CHAMBRE PARENTS to HALL
D7: Connects BAINS to HALL
D6: Connects BUREAU to HALL
D5: Connects LINGERIE to HALL
D4: Connects WC to HALL
D3: Connects HALL to PORCHE
D2: Connects PORCHE to CELLIER
D1: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE
D9: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2 (not needed for this route)
D10: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 (not needed for this route)
D11: Connects CELLIER to HALL (not needed for this route)

Step-by-step navigation plan from CHAMBRE PARENTS to CELLIER:

1. ApproachDoor(8)
2. OpenDoor(8)
3. GoThrough(8)
4. ApproachDoor(3)
5. OpenDoor(3)
6. GoThrough(3)
7. ApproachDoor(2)
8. OpenDoor(2)
9. GoThrough(2)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2}
  ]
}
```

This path efficiently navigates from CHAMBRE PARENTS to CELLIER using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
