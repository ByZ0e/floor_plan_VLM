Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the CELLIER to the HALL.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects CELLIER to GARAGES
D2: Connects HALL to DOUCHE
D3: Connects CELLIER to CUISINE
D4: Connects HALL to WC
D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
D6: Connects HALL to CUISINE
D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE

Now, for the navigation task from CELLIER to HALL, we only need to use one door:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the CELLIER to the HALL using the following steps:
1. Approach door D3, which connects the CELLIER to the CUISINE.
2. Open door D3.
3. Go through door D3, which will put you in the CUISINE, which is directly connected to the HALL.

Once you've gone through door D3, you'll be in the CUISINE, which is open to the HALL area. No additional doors need to be used to reach the HALL from this point.
