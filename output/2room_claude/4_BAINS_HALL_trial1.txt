Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list the relevant rooms and door connections, then provide a navigation plan from BAINS to HALL.

Relevant Room and Door Connections:
- BAINS is connected to HALL via door D2
- HALL is connected to CHAMBRE 1 via door D4
- HALL is connected to CHAMBRE 2 via door D5
- HALL is connected to PORCHE via door D6
- HALL is connected to CUISINE via door D7

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in BAINS
2. Use door D2 to enter HALL

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from BAINS to HALL using the single necessary door D2. No unnecessary doors or rooms are included in the path.
