Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the CELLIER to the HALL.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER
2. D2: Connects CELLIER and PORCHE
3. D3: Connects PORCHE and HALL
4. D4: Connects HALL and WC
5. D5: Connects HALL and LINGERIE
6. D6: Connects HALL and BUREAU
7. D7: Connects HALL and BAINS
8. D8: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE PARENTS
9. D9: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
10. D10: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
11. D11: Connects CELLIER and HALL

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in CELLIER
2. ApproachDoor(11)
3. OpenDoor(11)
4. GoThrough(11)

This sequence will take you directly from the CELLIER to the HALL using the most efficient path.

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CELLIER",
  "end": "HALL",
  "actions": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 11}
  ]
}
```

This plan uses only the necessary door (D11) to move directly from the CELLIER to the HALL, avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
