Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the relevant rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from PORCHE 1 to CELLIER 1.

Relevant Room and Door Connections:
- PORCHE 1 connects to HALL 1 via door D31
- HALL 1 connects to CELLIER 1 via door D13

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
1. Start in PORCHE 1
2. Approach door D31
3. Open door D31
4. Go through door D31 to enter HALL 1
5. Approach door D13
6. Open door D13
7. Go through door D13 to enter CELLIER 1

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D31"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D31"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D31"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D13"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D13"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D13"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from PORCHE 1 to CELLIER 1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
