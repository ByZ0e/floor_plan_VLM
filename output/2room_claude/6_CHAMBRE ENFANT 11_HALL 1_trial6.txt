Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from CHAMBRE ENFANT 11 to HALL 1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D91: Connects CHAMBRE ENFANT 11 to HALL 1
2. D101: Connects HALL 1 to HALL 1 (different sections)
3. D81: Connects HALL 1 to BAINS1
4. D71: Connects BAINS1 to BUREAU1
5. D61: Connects BUREAU1 to LINGERIE1
6. D51: Connects LINGERIE1 to HALL1
7. D41: Connects HALL1 to WC1
8. D31: Connects HALL1 to PORCHE1
9. D21: Connects PORCHE1 to CELLIER 1
10. D13: Connects CELLIER 1 to GARAGE 1
11. D111: Connects CELLIER 1 to HALL 1
12. D12: Connects HALL 1 to PORCHE

Navigation Plan:
To go from CHAMBRE ENFANT 11 to HALL 1, we only need to use one door:

1. ApproachDoor(91)
2. OpenDoor(91)
3. GoThrough(91)

This sequence will take you directly from CHAMBRE ENFANT 11 to HALL 1.

Here's the plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 91},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 91},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 91}
  ]
}
```

This is the most efficient path from CHAMBRE ENFANT 11 to HALL 1, using only the necessary door to reach the destination.
