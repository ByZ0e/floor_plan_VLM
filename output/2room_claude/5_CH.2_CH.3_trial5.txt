Thank you for providing the floor plan image. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan from CH.2 to CH.3.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CH.2 connects to DEGT via D6
2. DEGT connects to SEJOUR via D4
3. SEJOUR connects to CUISINE via D3
4. CUISINE connects to CELLIER via D2
5. CELLIER connects to CELLIER1 via D10
6. CELLIER1 connects to SEJOUR1 via D11
7. SEJOUR1 connects to DEGT1 via D41
8. DEGT1 connects to CH.3 via D51

Navigation Plan:
To go from CH.2 to CH.3, we need to follow this path: CH.2 -> DEGT -> SEJOUR -> CUISINE -> CELLIER -> CELLIER1 -> SEJOUR1 -> DEGT1 -> CH.3

Here's the step-by-step navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D41"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D41"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D41"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D51"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D51"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D51"}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan provides the most efficient path from CH.2 to CH.3 based on the provided floor plan, using only the necessary doors and rooms for traversal.
