Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan from BAINS to HALL.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects BAINS to HALL
- D2: Connects WC to HALL
- D3: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
- D4: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
- D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 2
- D6: Connects HALL to PORCHE
- D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE
- D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
- D9: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE
- D10: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE to TERRASSE COUVERTE

Navigation Plan:
To go from BAINS to HALL, we only need to use one door: D1.

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in BAINS
2. Approach D1
3. Open D1
4. Go through D1 to enter HALL

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from BAINS to HALL using only the necessary door (D1) that connects these two rooms.
