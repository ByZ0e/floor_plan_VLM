Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the connections and provide a navigation plan for you to move from CELLIER to PORCHE 1. Let's start by listing the relevant rooms and doors:

Room and Door Connections:
1. CELLIER connects to CUISINE via door D2
2. CUISINE connects to SEJOUR via door D3
3. SEJOUR connects to DEGT via door D4
4. DEGT connects to SEJOUR1 via door D9
5. SEJOUR1 connects to PORCHE1 via door D11

Now, I'll provide a step-by-step navigation plan based on these connections:

1. Start in CELLIER
2. ApproachDoor(D2)
3. OpenDoor(D2)
4. GoThrough(D2) to enter CUISINE
5. ApproachDoor(D3)
6. OpenDoor(D3)
7. GoThrough(D3) to enter SEJOUR
8. ApproachDoor(D4)
9. OpenDoor(D4)
10. GoThrough(D4) to enter DEGT
11. ApproachDoor(D9)
12. OpenDoor(D9)
13. GoThrough(D9) to enter SEJOUR1
14. ApproachDoor(D11)
15. OpenDoor(D11)
16. GoThrough(D11) to reach PORCHE1

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CELLIER",
  "end": "PORCHE1",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D11"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides an efficient route from CELLIER to PORCHE1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
