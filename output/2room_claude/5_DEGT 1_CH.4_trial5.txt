Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and their door connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from DEGT 1 to CH.4.

Room and Door Connections:
1. DEGT 1 - D51, D61
2. SEJOUR1 - D41, D31, D11
3. CUISINE 1 - D31, D21
4. CELLIER1 - D21
5. BAINS 1 - D71
6. WC 1 - D81
7. CH.4 - D61
8. CH.3 - D41, D51

Navigation Plan:
To get from DEGT 1 to CH.4, we only need to use one door: D61.

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in DEGT 1
2. ApproachDoor(D61)
3. OpenDoor(D61)
4. GoThrough(D61)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "DEGT 1",
  "end": "CH.4",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D61"}
  ]
}
```

This is the most efficient path from DEGT 1 to CH.4, using only the necessary door (D61) to reach the destination.
