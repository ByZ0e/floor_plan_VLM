Certainly! I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections based on the floor plan image, and then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Explicit Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE
D2: Connects CELLIER to PORCHE
D3: Connects PORCHE to HALL
D4: Connects HALL to WC
D5: Connects HALL to LINGERIE
D6: Connects HALL to BUREAU
D7: Connects HALL to BAINS
D8: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE PARENTS
D9: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
D10: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
D11: Connects CELLIER to HALL

Step-by-step solution:
1. We start in the CELLIER.
2. The most direct path to the HALL is through door D11.
3. We need to approach D11, open it, and go through it to reach the HALL.

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 11}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from the CELLIER to the HALL, using only the necessary door (D11) that directly connects these two spaces.
