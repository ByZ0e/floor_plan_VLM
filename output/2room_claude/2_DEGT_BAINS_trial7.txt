Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from DEGT to BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D4 connects SEJOUR and DEGT
2. D5 connects DEGT and CH.1
3. D6 connects DEGT and CH.2
4. D7 connects DEGT and BAINS
8. D8 connects DEGT and WC

Navigation Plan:

Starting from DEGT, we only need to use one door to reach BAINS. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(7)
2. OpenDoor(7)
3. GoThrough(7)

This sequence will take you directly from DEGT to BAINS using the most efficient path.

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "DEGT",
  "end": "BAINS",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7}
  ]
}
```

This plan ensures you navigate from DEGT to BAINS using only the necessary door (D7) without any unnecessary steps or rooms.
