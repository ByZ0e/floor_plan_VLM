Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from DEGT to BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
- D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
- D5: Connects CH.1 and DEGT
- D6: Connects CH.2 and DEGT
- D7: Connects DEGT and BAINS
- D8: Connects CUISINE and DEGT

Navigation Plan:

Starting from DEGT, we only need to use one door to reach BAINS. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(7)
2. OpenDoor(7)
3. GoThrough(7)

Now, I'll provide the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "DEGT",
  "end": "BAINS",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7}
  ]
}
```

This is the most efficient path from DEGT to BAINS, using only the necessary door (D7) that directly connects these two rooms.
