Certainly! I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections based on the floor plan, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan from BAINS to HALL.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects CELLIER and HALL
2. D2: Connects BAINS and HALL
3. D3: Connects WC and HALL
4. D4: Connects CHAMBRE 1 and HALL
5. D5: Connects CHAMBRE 2 and HALL
6. D6: Connects PORCHE and HALL
7. D7: Connects CUISINE and HALL
8. D8: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
9. D9: Connects CELLIER and GARAGE

Step-by-step solution:
Starting from BAINS, we only need to use one door (D2) to reach the HALL. Here's the detailed plan:

1. ApproachDoor(2)
2. OpenDoor(2)
3. GoThrough(2)

This sequence will take the robot from BAINS directly into the HALL, which is the desired destination.

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2}
  ]
}
```

This plan is the most efficient route from BAINS to HALL, using only the necessary door (D2) and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
