Certainly! I'll provide a clear list of rooms and doors with their connections, and then create a detailed navigation plan based on that information.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE
D2: Connects CELLIER to PORCHE
D3: Connects PORCHE to HALL
D4: Connects HALL to WC
D5: Connects HALL to LINGERIE
D6: Connects HALL to BUREAU
D7: Connects HALL to BAINS
D8: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE PARENTS
D9: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
D10: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
D11: Connects CELLIER to HALL

Now, let's create the navigation plan to go from CELLIER to HALL:

Step-by-step solution:
1. We start in the CELLIER.
2. The most direct path to the HALL is through door D11.
3. We need to approach D11, open it, and go through it to reach the HALL.

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 11}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the CELLIER to the HALL using only the necessary doors. The robot will approach door D11, open it, and go through it to reach the HALL, completing the navigation task.
