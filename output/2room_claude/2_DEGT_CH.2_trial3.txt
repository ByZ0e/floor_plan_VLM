Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll first list the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Explicit Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects SEJOUR and Porche
2. D2 connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
3. D3 connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
4. D4 connects SEJOUR and DEGT
5. D5 connects DEGT and CH.1
6. D6 connects DEGT and CH.2
7. D7 connects DEGT and BAINS
8. D8 connects DEGT and WC

Step-by-step navigation plan from DEGT to CH.2:

1. ApproachDoor(6)
2. OpenDoor(6)
3. GoThrough(6)

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "DEGT",
  "end": "CH.2",
  "actions": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from the starting point (DEGT) to the destination (CH.2) using only the necessary doors and actions.
