Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan from CUISINE to SEJOUR.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

1. CUISINE connects to SEJOUR via D3
2. SEJOUR connects to DEGT via D4
3. DEGT connects to CH.2 via D6
4. DEGT connects to CH.1 via D5
5. CELLIER connects to CUISINE via D2
6. Porche connects to SEJOUR via D1
7. BAINS connects to DEGT via D7
8. WC connects to DEGT via D8

Now, let's create the navigation plan from CUISINE to SEJOUR:

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CUISINE
2. Use D3 to go from CUISINE to SEJOUR

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from CUISINE to SEJOUR using only the necessary doors. The robot will approach D3, open it, and go through to reach the SEJOUR.
