Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from DEGT to BAINS.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
D5: Connects CH.1 and DEGT
D6: Connects DEGT and CH.2
D7: Connects DEGT and BAINS
D8: Connects CUISINE and BAINS

Step-by-step navigation plan:

1. Start in DEGT
2. ApproachDoor(D7)
3. OpenDoor(D7)
4. GoThrough(D7)

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "DEGT",
  "end": "BAINS",
  "steps": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from DEGT to BAINS using only the necessary doors. The robot will approach door D7, which connects DEGT directly to BAINS, open it, and go through to reach the destination.
