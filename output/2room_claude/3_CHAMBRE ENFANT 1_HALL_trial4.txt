Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 to the HALL.

Room and Door Connections:
D10: Connects CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 to HALL
D9: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
D8: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE PARENTS
D7: Connects HALL to BAINS
D6: Connects HALL to BUREAU
D5: Connects HALL to LINGERIE
D4: Connects HALL to WC
D3: Connects HALL to PORCHE
D2: Connects PORCHE to CELLIER
D1: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE
D11: Connects CELLIER to HALL

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
2. Use D10 to enter the HALL

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CHAMBRE ENFANT 1",
  "end": "HALL",
  "steps": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 10}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 to the HALL, using only the necessary door (D10) to complete the navigation task.
