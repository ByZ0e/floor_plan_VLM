Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a detailed navigation plan to get from DEGT 1 to CH.4.

Room and Door Connections:
D31: Connects SEJOUR1 and CUISINE1
D41: Connects SEJOUR1 and DEGT1
D51: Connects DEGT1 and CH.3
D61: Connects DEGT1 and CH.4
D71: Connects DEGT1 and BAINS1

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in DEGT1
2. Use door D61 to go directly to CH.4

Final Navigation Plan in JSON format:
```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D61"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from DEGT1 to CH.4 using only the necessary doors. The robot will approach door D61, open it, and go through to reach CH.4 directly from DEGT1.
