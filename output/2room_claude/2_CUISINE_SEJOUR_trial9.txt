Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the CUISINE to the SEJOUR.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

1. D1: Connects SEJOUR and Porche
2. D2: Connects CUISINE and CELLIER
3. D3: Connects CUISINE and SEJOUR
4. D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
5. D5: Connects CH.1 and DEGT
6. D6: Connects CH.2 and DEGT
7. D7: Connects BAINS and DEGT
8. D8: Connects WC and DEGT

Step-by-step navigation plan:

1. Start in CUISINE
2. Use D3 to enter SEJOUR

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 3
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the CUISINE to the SEJOUR, using only the necessary door (D3) to complete the task.
