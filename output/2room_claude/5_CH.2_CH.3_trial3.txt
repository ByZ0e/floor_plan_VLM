Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from CH.2 to CH.3.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D6: Connects CH.2 and DEGT
2. D8: Connects DEGT and WC
3. D7: Connects DEGT and BAINS
4. D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
5. D5: Connects CH.1 and DEGT
3. D9: Connects CH.2 and CH.3
4. D41: Connects CH.3 and DEGT 1
5. D51: Connects CH.3 and CH.4

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in CH.2
2. Approach and go through D9 to enter CH.3

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"}
  ]
}
```

This is the most direct and efficient path from CH.2 to CH.3, using only the necessary door (D9) that connects these two rooms directly.
