Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections based on the image, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D71 connects CUISINE1 and HALL1
2. D81 connects CUISINE1 and TERRASSE COUVERTE1
3. D61 connects HALL1 and PORCHE1
4. D51 connects HALL1 and CHAMBRE3
5. D41 connects HALL1 and CHAMBRE4
6. D21 connects HALL1 and WC1
7. D11 connects HALL1 and CELLIER1
8. D91 connects CELLIER1 and GARAGE1

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
Starting in CUISINE1, we need to reach TERRASSE COUVERTE1. Based on the floor plan and the connections listed above, here's the most efficient path:

1. ApproachDoor(D81)
2. OpenDoor(D81)
3. GoThrough(D81)

This sequence will take you directly from CUISINE1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE1 using the most efficient path.

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D81"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D81"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D81"}
  ]
}
```

This plan uses only the necessary door (D81) to move directly from CUISINE1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE1, avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
