Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from DEGT 1 to CH.4.

Room and Door Connections:
D31: Connects SEJOUR1 and CUISINE1
D41: Connects SEJOUR1 and DEGT1
D51: Connects DEGT1 and CH.3
D61: Connects DEGT1 and CH.4
D71: Connects DEGT1 and BAINS1

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in DEGT1
2. Use D61 to go directly from DEGT1 to CH.4

Final Navigation Plan in JSON format:
```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D61"}
  ]
}
```

This is the most efficient path from DEGT1 to CH.4, using only the necessary door (D61) that directly connects these two rooms.
