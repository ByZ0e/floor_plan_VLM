Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll first list the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D71 connects CUISINE1 and HALL1
2. D81 connects CUISINE1 and TERRASSE COUVERTE 1

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
Starting from CUISINE1, we need to reach TERRASSE COUVERTE 1. There's a direct connection through door D81.

Here's the efficient navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D81"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D81"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D81"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently guide you from CUISINE1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE 1 using the most direct path available.
