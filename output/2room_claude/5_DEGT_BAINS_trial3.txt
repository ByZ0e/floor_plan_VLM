Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from DEGT to BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects Porche to SEJOUR
2. D2: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
3. D3: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
4. D4: Connects SEJOUR to DEGT
5. D5: Connects DEGT to CH.1
6. D6: Connects DEGT to CH.2
7. D7: Connects DEGT to BAINS
8. D8: Connects DEGT to WC
9. D9: Connects CH.2 to CH.4
10. D10: Connects CELLIER to CUISINE
11. D11: Connects Porche1 to SEJOUR1
21. D21: Connects CELLIER1 to CUISINE1
31. D31: Connects SEJOUR1 to CUISINE1
41. D41: Connects SEJOUR1 to DEGT1
51. D51: Connects DEGT1 to CH.3
61. D61: Connects DEGT1 to CH.4
71. D71: Connects DEGT1 to BAINS1

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in DEGT
2. ApproachDoor(D7)
3. OpenDoor(D7)
4. GoThrough(D7)

JSON format of the final path:
```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"}
  ]
}
```

This is the most efficient path from DEGT to BAINS, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or actions.
