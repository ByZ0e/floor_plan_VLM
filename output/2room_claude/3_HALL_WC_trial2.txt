Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from the HALL to the WC.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects HALL to CELLIER
2. D2: Connects CELLIER to PORCHE
3. D3: Connects PORCHE to HALL
4. D4: Connects HALL to WC
5. D5: Connects HALL to LINGERIE
6. D6: Connects HALL to BUREAU
7. D7: Connects HALL to BAINS
8. D8: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE PARENTS
9. D9: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
10. D10: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
11. D11: Connects HALL to CELLIER

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in the HALL
2. Approach door D4
3. Open door D4
4. Go through door D4 to reach the WC

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "HALL",
  "end": "WC",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from the HALL to the WC, using only the necessary door (D4) to reach the destination.
