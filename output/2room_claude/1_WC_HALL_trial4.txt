Thank you for providing the floor plan and instructions. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the WC to the HALL.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects CELLIER and HALL
D2: Connects WC and HALL
D3: Connects WC and HALL
D4: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 1
D5: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 2
D6: Connects HALL and PORCHE
D7: Connects HALL and CUISINE
D8: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Connects CELLIER and GARAGE

Navigation Plan:
To go from the WC to the HALL, we only need to use one door. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(3)
2. OpenDoor(3)
3. GoThrough(3)

This sequence will take you directly from the WC to the HALL.

Here's the plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "WC",
  "end": "HALL",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

This is the most efficient path from the WC to the HALL, using only the necessary door (D3) to complete the navigation task.
