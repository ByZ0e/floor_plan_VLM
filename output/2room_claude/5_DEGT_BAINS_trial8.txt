Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from DEGT to BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects Porche to SEJOUR
2. D2: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
3. D3: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
4. D4: Connects SEJOUR to DEGT
5. D5: Connects DEGT to CH.1
6. D6: Connects DEGT to CH.2
7. D7: Connects DEGT to BAINS
8. D8: Connects DEGT to WC
9. D9: Connects CH.2 to CH.4
10. D10: Connects CELLIER to CUISINE
11. D11: Connects Porche1 to SEJOUR1
12. D21: Connects SEJOUR1 to CUISINE1
13. D31: Connects SEJOUR1 to CUISINE1
14. D41: Connects SEJOUR1 to DEGT1
15. D51: Connects DEGT1 to CH.3
16. D61: Connects DEGT1 to CH.4
17. D71: Connects DEGT1 to BAINS1
18. D81: Connects DEGT1 to WC1

Navigation Plan:
Starting from DEGT, we need to reach BAINS. There is a direct connection between these two rooms through door D7.

Here's the step-by-step navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D7"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D7"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D7"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from DEGT to BAINS using only the necessary door (D7) that directly connects these two rooms.
