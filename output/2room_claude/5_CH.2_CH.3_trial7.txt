Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from CH.2 to CH.3.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects Porche and SEJOUR
2. D2: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
3. D3: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
4. D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
5. D5: Connects DEGT and CH.1
6. D6: Connects DEGT and CH.2
7. D7: Connects DEGT and BAINS
8. D8: Connects DEGT and WC
9. D9: Connects CH.2 and CH.3
10. D10: Connects CELLIER and CUISINE
11. D11: Connects Porche1 and SEJOUR1
12. D21: Connects SEJOUR1 and CUISINE1
13. D31: Connects SEJOUR1 and CUISINE1
14. D41: Connects SEJOUR1 and DEGT1
15. D51: Connects DEGT1 and CH.3
16. D61: Connects DEGT1 and CH.4
17. D71: Connects DEGT1 and BAINS1
18. D81: Connects DEGT1 and WC1

Step-by-step navigation plan from CH.2 to CH.3:
1. ApproachDoor(D9)
2. OpenDoor(D9)
3. GoThrough(D9)

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "doorNumber": 9},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "doorNumber": 9},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "doorNumber": 9}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from CH.2 to CH.3 using only the necessary door (D9) that connects these two rooms directly.
