Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:

D8: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE and CUISINE
D7: Connects CUISINE and HALL
D6: Connects HALL and PORCHE
D5: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 2
D4: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 1
D3: Connects HALL and WC
D2: Connects HALL and BAINS
D1: Connects HALL and CELLIER
D9: Connects CELLIER and GARAGE

Step-by-step navigation plan:

1. Start in TERRASSE COUVERTE
2. Approach door D8
3. Open door D8
4. Go through door D8 to enter CUISINE

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to the CUISINE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or actions.
