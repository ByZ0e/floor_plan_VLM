Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan from CUISINE to SEJOUR.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D2: Connects CUISINE and SEJOUR
2. D3: Connects CUISINE and SEJOUR
3. D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
5. D1: Connects SEJOUR and Porche (not needed for this route)
6. D5, D6, D7, D8: Connect to other rooms but are not relevant for this route

Step-by-step Solution:
To navigate from CUISINE to SEJOUR, we only need to use one door: D3.

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently take you from CUISINE to SEJOUR using the most direct route available according to the floor plan.
