Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from DEGT to BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Porche <-> SEJOUR
D2: SEJOUR <-> CUISINE
D3: SEJOUR <-> CUISINE
D4: SEJOUR <-> DEGT
D5: DEGT <-> CH.1
D6: DEGT <-> CH.2
D7: DEGT <-> BAINS
D8: DEGT <-> WC
D9: CH.2 <-> CH.4
D10: CELLIER <-> CUISINE
D11: Porche1 <-> SEJOUR1
D21: SEJOUR1 <-> CUISINE1
D31: SEJOUR1 <-> CUISINE1
D41: SEJOUR1 <-> DEGT1
D51: DEGT1 <-> CH.3
D61: DEGT1 <-> CH.4
D71: DEGT1 <-> BAINS1
D81: DEGT1 <-> WC1

Navigation Plan:
Starting from DEGT, we need to reach BAINS. Based on the room and door connections, we can see that there's a direct path from DEGT to BAINS through door D7.

Here's the step-by-step navigation plan:

1. ApproachDoor(7)
2. OpenDoor(7)
3. GoThrough(7)

Now, let's present this in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient path from DEGT to BAINS using only the necessary doors.
