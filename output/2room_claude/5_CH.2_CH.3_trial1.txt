Thank you for providing this floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms, doors, and connections, then provide a navigation plan from CH.2 to CH.3.

Explicit Room and Door Connections:

D4: Connects SEJOUR to DEGT
D5: Connects CH.1 to DEGT
D6: Connects CH.2 to DEGT
D8: Connects DEGT to WC
D7: Connects DEGT to BAINS
D9: Connects CH.2 to CH.3
D41: Connects SEJOUR1 to DEGT1
D51: Connects CH.3 to DEGT1
D61: Connects CH.4 to DEGT1

Step-by-step navigation plan from CH.2 to CH.3:

1. Start in CH.2
2. Use D9 to go directly from CH.2 to CH.3

Here's the efficient navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CH.2",
  "end": "CH.3",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from CH.2 to CH.3 using only the necessary door (D9) that connects these two rooms directly.
