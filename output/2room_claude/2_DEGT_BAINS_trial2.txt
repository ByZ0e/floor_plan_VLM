Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from DEGT to BAINS.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

1. D4 connects SEJOUR and DEGT
2. D5 connects DEGT and CH.1
3. D6 connects DEGT and CH.2
4. D7 connects DEGT and BAINS
8. D8 connects DEGT and WC

Step-by-step solution:
Starting from DEGT, we need to reach BAINS. Looking at the floor plan and the door connections, we can see that there's a direct path from DEGT to BAINS through door D7.

Here's the efficient navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 7
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 7
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 7
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from DEGT to BAINS using the most direct route available.
