Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll first list the relevant rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from CHAMBRE ENFANT 11 to HALL 1.

Relevant Room and Door Connections:
- CHAMBRE ENFANT 11 <-> D10 <-> HALL 1
- HALL 1 <-> D9 <-> HALL 1
- HALL 1 <-> D101 <-> HALL 1
- HALL 1 <-> D91 <-> HALL 1

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in CHAMBRE ENFANT 11
2. Approach door D10
3. Open door D10
4. Go through door D10 to enter HALL 1

This is the most direct and efficient path from CHAMBRE ENFANT 11 to HALL 1 based on the floor plan provided. Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D10"}
  ]
}
```

This plan takes you directly from CHAMBRE ENFANT 11 to HALL 1 using only the necessary door (D10). No other doors or rooms need to be traversed for this particular navigation task.
