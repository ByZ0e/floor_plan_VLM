Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the PORCHE to the CELLIER.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER
- D2: Connects PORCHE to CELLIER
- D3: Connects PORCHE to HALL
- D4: Connects HALL to WC
- D5: Connects HALL to LINGERIE
- D6: Connects HALL to BUREAU
- D7: Connects HALL to BAINS
- D8: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE PARENTS
- D9: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
- D10: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
- D11: Connects HALL to CELLIER

Navigation Plan:
To go from the PORCHE to the CELLIER, we can use door D2 directly. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(2)
2. OpenDoor(2)
3. GoThrough(2)

Now, I'll provide the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "PORCHE",
  "end": "CELLIER",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2}
  ]
}
```

This is the most efficient path from the PORCHE to the CELLIER, using only the necessary door (D2) that directly connects these two areas.
