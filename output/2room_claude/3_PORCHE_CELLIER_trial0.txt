Certainly! I'll analyze the floor plan, list the room and door connections, and then provide a detailed navigation plan for you to move from the PORCHE to the CELLIER.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects PORCHE to CELLIER
D2: Connects PORCHE to CELLIER
D3: Connects HALL to PORCHE
D4: Connects HALL to WC
D5: Connects HALL to LINGERIE
D6: Connects HALL to BUREAU
D7: Connects HALL to BAINS
D8: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE PARENTS
D9: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
D10: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
D11: Connects HALL to CELLIER

Step-by-step solution:

1. You are starting in the PORCHE.
2. The most direct route to the CELLIER is through door D2.

Navigation Plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "PORCHE",
  "end": "CELLIER",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the PORCHE to the CELLIER using the available doors. You'll approach door D2, which connects the PORCHE directly to the CELLIER, open it, and go through it to reach your destination.
