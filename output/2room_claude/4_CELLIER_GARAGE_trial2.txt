Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the CELLIER to the GARAGE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CELLIER - D9 - GARAGE
2. CELLIER - D1 - HALL
3. HALL - D2 - WC
4. HALL - D3 - CHAMBRE 1
5. HALL - D4 - HALL
6. HALL - D5 - CHAMBRE 2
7. HALL - D6 - PORCHE
8. PORCHE - D7 - CUISINE
9. CUISINE - D8 - TERRASSE COUVERTE
10. TERRASSE COUVERTE - D10 - TERRASSE

Based on these connections, here's the step-by-step navigation plan from CELLIER to GARAGE:

1. Start in CELLIER
2. ApproachDoor(D9)
3. OpenDoor(D9)
4. GoThrough(D9)

Now, let's format this as a JSON sequence:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"}
  ]
}
```

This is the most efficient path from CELLIER to GARAGE, using only the necessary door (D9) that directly connects these two rooms. The plan avoids any unnecessary rooms or doors, ensuring a direct and correct path to the destination.
