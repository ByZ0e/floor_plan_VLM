Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from CH.2 to CH.3.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

1. D5 connects CH.1 and DEGT
2. D6 connects CH.2 and DEGT
3. D7 connects DEGT and BAINS
4. D8 connects DEGT and WC
5. D9 connects CH.2 and CH.3
6. D41 connects CH.3 and DEGT 1
7. D51 connects CH.3 and DEGT 1
8. D61 connects CH.4 and DEGT 1
9. D71 connects DEGT 1 and BAINS 1
10. D81 connects DEGT 1 and WC 1

Step-by-step solution:
To navigate from CH.2 to CH.3, we only need to use one door:

1. ApproachDoor(9)
2. OpenDoor(9)
3. GoThrough(9)

This sequence will take the robot directly from CH.2 to CH.3 using the most efficient path.

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CH.2",
  "end": "CH.3",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 9}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from CH.2 to CH.3 using only the necessary door (D9) that connects these two rooms.
