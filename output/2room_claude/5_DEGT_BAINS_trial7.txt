Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from DEGT to BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects Porche to SEJOUR
D2: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
D3: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
D4: Connects SEJOUR to DEGT
D5: Connects DEGT to CH.1
D6: Connects DEGT to CH.2
D7: Connects DEGT to BAINS
D8: Connects DEGT to WC
D9: Connects CH.2 to CH.4
D10: Connects CELLIER to CUISINE
D11: Connects Porche1 to SEJOUR1
D21: Connects CELLIER1 to CUISINE1
D31: Connects SEJOUR1 to CUISINE1
D41: Connects SEJOUR1 to DEGT1
D51: Connects DEGT1 to CH.3
D61: Connects DEGT1 to CH.4
D71: Connects DEGT1 to BAINS1

Navigation Plan:
To go from DEGT to BAINS, we only need to use one door:

1. ApproachDoor(7)
2. OpenDoor(7)
3. GoThrough(7)

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "DEGT",
  "end": "BAINS",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7}
  ]
}
```

This is the most efficient path from DEGT to BAINS, using only the necessary door (D7) that directly connects these two rooms.
