Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll first list the rooms and door connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from WC 1 to HALL 1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D21: Connects WC 1 to HALL 1
2. D31: Connects CHAMBRE 4 to HALL 1
3. D41: Connects CHAMBRE 4 to HALL 1
4. D51: Connects CHAMBRE 3 to HALL 1
5. D61: Connects HALL 1 to PORCHE 1
6. D71: Connects CUISINE 1 to HALL 1
7. D81: Connects CUISINE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE 1
8. D91: Connects CELLIER 1 to GARAGE 1
9. D11: Connects BAINS 1 to HALL 1

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
1. Start in WC 1
2. ApproachDoor(D21)
3. OpenDoor(D21)
4. GoThrough(D21)

The navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "WC 1",
  "end": "HALL 1",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D21"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D21"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D21"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from WC 1 to HALL 1, using only the necessary door (D21) that connects these two spaces.
