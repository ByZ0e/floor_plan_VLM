Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects SEJOUR and Porche
D2: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
D3: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
D5: Connects DEGT and CH.1
D6: Connects DEGT and CH.2
D7: Connects DEGT and BAINS
D8: Connects DEGT and WC

Navigation Plan:
To navigate from DEGT to CH.2, we only need to use one door: D6.

Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. Start in DEGT
2. ApproachDoor(6)
3. OpenDoor(6)
4. GoThrough(6)

Now, let's present this in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "DEGT",
  "end": "CH.2",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from DEGT to CH.2, using only the necessary door (D6) to reach the destination. The plan avoids any unnecessary doors or rooms, ensuring a direct and correct path to the goal.
