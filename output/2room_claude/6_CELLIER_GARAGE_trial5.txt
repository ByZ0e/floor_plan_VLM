Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the CELLIER to the GARAGE.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER
D2: Connects GARAGE and PORCHE
D3: Connects PORCHE and HALL
D4: Connects HALL and WC
D5: Connects HALL and LINGERIE
D6: Connects HALL and BUREAU
D7: Connects HALL and BAINS
D8: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE PARENTS
D9: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
D10: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
D11: Connects CELLIER and HALL
D12: Connects HALL (upper) and HALL (lower)

Based on these connections, here's the step-by-step navigation plan to go from CELLIER to GARAGE:

1. Start in CELLIER
2. ApproachDoor(D1)
3. OpenDoor(D1)
4. GoThrough(D1)

This is the most direct and efficient path from CELLIER to GARAGE. Now, I'll provide the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CELLIER",
  "end": "GARAGE",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"}
  ]
}
```

This plan ensures that you take the most direct route from CELLIER to GARAGE using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
