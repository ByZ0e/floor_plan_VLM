Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the CELLIER to the GARAGE.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects CELLIER and GARAGE
D2: Connects PORCHE and HALL
D3: Connects PORCHE and HALL
D4: Connects HALL and WC
D5: Connects HALL and LINGERIE
D6: Connects HALL and BUREAU
D7: Connects HALL and BAINS
D8: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE PARENTS
D9: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
D10: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
D11: Connects CELLIER and HALL
D12: Connects HALL and PORCHE (upper floor)

Navigation Plan:
Starting from CELLIER, we need to go directly to the GARAGE. There's a direct connection through door D1.

Step-by-step solution:
1. ApproachDoor(1)
2. OpenDoor(1)
3. GoThrough(1)

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient path from the CELLIER to the GARAGE using only the necessary door (D1) that connects these two spaces directly.
