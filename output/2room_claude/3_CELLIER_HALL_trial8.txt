Certainly! I'll analyze the floor plan, list the room and door connections, and then provide a detailed navigation plan for you to move from the CELLIER to the HALL.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER
D2: Connects CELLIER and PORCHE
D3: Connects PORCHE and HALL
D4: Connects HALL and WC
D5: Connects HALL and LINGERIE
D6: Connects HALL and BUREAU
D7: Connects HALL and BAINS
D8: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE PARENTS
D9: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
D10: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
D11: Connects CELLIER and HALL

Step-by-step solution:

1. You are starting in the CELLIER.
2. The most direct path to the HALL is through door D11.
3. You need to approach D11, open it, and go through it to reach the HALL.

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 11
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 11
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 11
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently guide you from the CELLIER to the HALL using the most direct route available based on the floor plan provided.
