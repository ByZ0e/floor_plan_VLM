Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms, doors, and their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the HALL to the WC.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects HALL to CELLIER
D2: Connects CELLIER to PORCHE
D3: Connects PORCHE to HALL
D4: Connects HALL to WC
D5: Connects HALL to LINGERIE
D6: Connects HALL to BUREAU
D7: Connects HALL to BAINS
D8: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE PARENTS
D9: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
D10: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
D11: Connects CELLIER to HALL

Step-by-step solution:
Starting from the HALL, we need to reach the WC. The most direct path is to use door D4, which connects the HALL directly to the WC.

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 4
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the HALL to the WC, using only the necessary door (D4) to reach the destination.
