Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms, doors, and their connections, then provide a navigation plan from the CELLIER to the HALL.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER
D2: Connects GARAGE to PORCHE
D3: Connects PORCHE to HALL
D4: Connects HALL to WC
D5: Connects HALL to LINGERIE
D6: Connects HALL to BUREAU
D7: Connects HALL to BAINS
D8: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE PARENTS
D9: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
D10: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
D11: Connects CELLIER to HALL
D12: Connects GARAGE to HALL (upper part of the floor plan)

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CELLIER
2. Use D11 to go from CELLIER to HALL

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 11}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from the CELLIER to the HALL using only the necessary doors.
