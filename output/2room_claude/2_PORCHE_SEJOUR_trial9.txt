Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the PORCHE to the SEJOUR.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects PORCHE and SEJOUR
2. D2 connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
3. D3 connects CUISINE and SEJOUR
4. D4 connects SEJOUR and DEGT
5. D5 connects CH.1 and DEGT
6. D6 connects DEGT and CH.2
7. D7 connects DEGT and BAINS
8. D8 connects DEGT and WC

For the navigation task from PORCHE to SEJOUR, we only need to use one door:

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in PORCHE
2. Approach D1
3. Open D1
4. Go through D1 to enter SEJOUR

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates you from the PORCHE to the SEJOUR using only the necessary door (D1) without any unnecessary steps or rooms.
