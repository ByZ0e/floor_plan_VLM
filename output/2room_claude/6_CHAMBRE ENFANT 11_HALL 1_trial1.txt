Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll start by listing the relevant rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Relevant Room and Door Connections:
- CHAMBRE ENFANT 11 connects to HALL 1 via door D101
- HALL 1 connects to HALL 1 (different sections) via doors D91, D61, D51, D41, and D111

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
1. Start in CHAMBRE ENFANT 11
2. ApproachDoor(D101)
3. OpenDoor(D101)
4. GoThrough(D101)

This plan will take you from CHAMBRE ENFANT 11 directly to HALL 1, which is the goal location. No further actions are needed as you'll already be in HALL 1 after going through door D101.

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D101"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D101"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D101"}
  ]
}
```

This is the most efficient path to reach HALL 1 from CHAMBRE ENFANT 11, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or actions.
