Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from DEGT to BAINS.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

1. D1: Connects Porche to SEJOUR
2. D2: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
3. D3: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
4. D4: Connects SEJOUR to DEGT
5. D5: Connects DEGT to CH.1
6. D6: Connects DEGT to CH.2
7. D7: Connects DEGT to BAINS
8. D8: Connects DEGT to WC
9. D9: Connects CH.2 to CH.4
10. D10: Connects CELLIER to CUISINE
11. D11: Connects Porche1 to SEJOUR1
21. D21: Connects CELLIER1 to CUISINE1
31. D31: Connects SEJOUR1 to CUISINE1
41. D41: Connects SEJOUR1 to DEGT1
51. D51: Connects DEGT1 to CH.3
61. D61: Connects DEGT1 to CH.4
71. D71: Connects DEGT1 to BAINS1

Navigation Plan:
To go from DEGT to BAINS, we only need to use one door: D7.

Here's the step-by-step navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "doorNumber": 7
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "doorNumber": 7
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "doorNumber": 7
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from DEGT to BAINS using the most direct path available.
