Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the CELLIER to the GARAGE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
2. D2: Connects HALL to BAINS
3. D3: Connects HALL to WC
4. D4: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
5. D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 2
6. D6: Connects HALL to PORCHE
7. D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE
8. D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
9. D9: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE

Navigation Plan:
To go from the CELLIER to the GARAGE, we only need to use one door: D9. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(9)
2. OpenDoor(9)
3. GoThrough(9)

This sequence will take you directly from the CELLIER to the GARAGE using the most efficient path.

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 9}
  ]
}
```

This plan ensures you navigate from the CELLIER to the GARAGE using only the necessary door (D9) without passing through any unnecessary rooms or doors.
