Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the CELLIER to the CUISINE.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

1. CELLIER - connected to CUISINE via D2
2. CUISINE - connected to CELLIER via D2, connected to SEJOUR via D3
3. SEJOUR - connected to CUISINE via D3, connected to CH.1 via D4
4. CH.1 - connected to SEJOUR via D4, connected to DEGT via D5
5. DEGT - connected to CH.1 via D5, connected to CH.2 via D6, connected to BAINS via D7
6. CH.2 - connected to DEGT via D6
7. BAINS - connected to DEGT via D7
8. Porche - connected to SEJOUR via D1 (not needed for this navigation)

Navigation Plan:

To go from CELLIER to CUISINE, we only need to use one door (D2). Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(2)
2. OpenDoor(2)
3. GoThrough(2)

Now, I'll provide the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CELLIER",
  "end": "CUISINE",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the CELLIER to the CUISINE, using only the necessary door (D2) that directly connects these two rooms.
