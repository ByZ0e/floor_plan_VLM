Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the HALL to the WC.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects HALL to CELLIER
2. D2: Connects CELLIER to PORCHE
3. D3: Connects PORCHE to HALL
4. D4: Connects HALL to WC
5. D5: Connects HALL to LINGERIE
6. D6: Connects HALL to BUREAU
7. D7: Connects HALL to BAINS
8. D8: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE PARENTS
9. D9: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
10. D10: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
11. D11: Connects HALL to CELLIER

Navigation Plan:
To reach the WC from the HALL, we only need to use one door: D4.

Here's the step-by-step plan:
1. ApproachDoor(4)
2. OpenDoor(4)
3. GoThrough(4)

And here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the HALL to the WC using only the necessary door (D4) without passing through any unnecessary rooms or doors.
