Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from CELLIER to PORCHE 1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D10: Connects CELLIER and CELLIER1
2. D2: Connects CELLIER and CUISINE
3. D3: Connects CUISINE and SEJOUR
4. D1: Connects SEJOUR and PORCHE
5. D11: Connects CELLIER1 and PORCHE1

Navigation Plan:
To go from CELLIER to PORCHE 1, we need to use the following sequence of actions:

1. ApproachDoor(D10)
2. OpenDoor(D10)
3. GoThrough(D10)
4. ApproachDoor(D11)
5. OpenDoor(D11)
6. GoThrough(D11)

This plan takes you from CELLIER through CELLIER1 and directly to PORCHE1, which is the most efficient route based on the floor plan provided.

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D11"}
  ]
}
```

This path avoids unnecessary rooms and uses only the required doors to reach the destination efficiently.
