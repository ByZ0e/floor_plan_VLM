Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from CUISINE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE 1.

Room and Door Connections:
- D71: Connects CUISINE 1 and HALL1
- D81: Connects CUISINE 1 and TERRASSE COUVERTE 1
- D61: Connects HALL1 and PORCHE 1
- D51: Connects HALL1 and CHAMBRE 3
- D41: Connects HALL1 and CHAMBRE 4
- D31: Connects HALL1 and WC 1
- D21: Connects HALL1 and BAINS 1
- D11: Connects HALL1 and CELLIER 1
- D91: Connects CELLIER 1 and GARAGE 1
- D10: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE 1 and TERRASSE COUVERTE 1 (exterior)

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in CUISINE 1
2. ApproachDoor(D81)
3. OpenDoor(D81)
4. GoThrough(D81)

This plan takes you directly from CUISINE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE 1 using the most efficient path.

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CUISINE 1",
  "end": "TERRASSE COUVERTE 1",
  "actions": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D81"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D81"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D81"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from CUISINE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE 1, using only the necessary door (D81) to reach the destination.
