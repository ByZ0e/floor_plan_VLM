Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from CUISINE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE 1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D71 connects CUISINE 1 and HALL1
2. D81 connects CUISINE 1 and TERRASSE COUVERTE 1
3. D61 connects HALL1 and PORCHE 1
4. D51 connects HALL1 and CHAMBRE 3
5. D41 connects HALL1 and CHAMBRE 4
6. D31 connects HALL1 and WC 1
7. D21 connects HALL1 and BAINS 1
8. D11 connects HALL1 and CELLIER 1
9. D91 connects CELLIER 1 and GARAGE 1

Navigation Plan:
To go from CUISINE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE 1, we only need to use one door: D81.

Here's the step-by-step navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D81"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D81"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D81"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from CUISINE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE 1, using only the necessary door (D81) that directly connects these two areas. No other doors or rooms need to be traversed for this particular navigation task.
