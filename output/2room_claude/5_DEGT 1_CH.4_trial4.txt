Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from DEGT 1 to CH.4.

Room and Door Connections:
D31: Connects SEJOUR1 and CUISINE1
D41: Connects SEJOUR1 and DEGT1
D51: Connects DEGT1 and CH.3
D61: Connects DEGT1 and CH.4
D71: Connects DEGT1 and BAINS1

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in DEGT1
2. Use door D61 to go directly from DEGT1 to CH.4

Final Navigation Plan in JSON format:
```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 61},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 61},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 61}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from DEGT1 to CH.4 using only the necessary door (D61) that connects these two rooms directly.
