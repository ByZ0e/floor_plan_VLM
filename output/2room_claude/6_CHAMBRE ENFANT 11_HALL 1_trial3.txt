Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list the relevant rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from CHAMBRE ENFANT 11 to HALL 1.

Relevant Room and Door Connections:
- CHAMBRE ENFANT 11 <-> D10 <-> HALL 1
- HALL 1 <-> D9 <-> HALL 1
- HALL 1 <-> D6 <-> BUREAU1
- BUREAU1 <-> D5 <-> LINGERIE1
- LINGERIE1 <-> D4 <-> HALL1
- HALL1 <-> D3 <-> PORCHE1
- PORCHE1 <-> D2 <-> HALL 1

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in CHAMBRE ENFANT 11
2. ApproachDoor(D10)
3. OpenDoor(D10)
4. GoThrough(D10)

Now you are in HALL 1, which is the destination. The navigation is complete.

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D10"}
  ]
}
```

This is the most efficient path from CHAMBRE ENFANT 11 to HALL 1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
