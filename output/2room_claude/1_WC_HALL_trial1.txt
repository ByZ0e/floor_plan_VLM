Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects Cellier and Hall
D2: Connects WC and Hall
D3: Connects WC and Hall
D4: Connects Hall and Chambre 1
D5: Connects Hall and Chambre 2
D6: Connects Hall and Porche
D7: Connects Hall and Cuisine
D8: Connects Cuisine and Terrasse Couverte
D9: Connects Cellier and Garage

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
Starting from the WC, we need to reach the Hall. There are two doors connecting the WC to the Hall: D2 and D3. We'll use D3 as it appears to be the most direct route.

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the WC to the Hall using the most direct route available.
