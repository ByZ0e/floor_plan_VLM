Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll start by listing the rooms and their door connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CELLIER: Connected to HALL via D1
2. GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER via D9
3. BAINS: Connected to HALL via D2
4. WC: Connected to HALL via D3
5. CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D4
6. CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL via D5
7. PORCHE: Connected to HALL via D6
8. CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D7
9. TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE via D8

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in CELLIER
2. Use D1 to enter HALL
3. Use D9 to enter GARAGE

Now, I'll provide the detailed navigation plan in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D9"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D9"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D9"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from the CELLIER to the GARAGE, using only the necessary doors (D1 and D9) and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
