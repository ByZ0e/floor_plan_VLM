Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll first list the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects SEJOUR and Porche
2. D2: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
3. D3: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
4. D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
5. D5: Connects DEGT and CH.1
6. D6: Connects DEGT and CH.2
7. D7: Connects DEGT and BAINS
8. D8: Connects DEGT and WC

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
Starting from DEGT to reach CH.2, we only need to use one door: D6.

Here's the detailed plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D6"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D6"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D6"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from DEGT to CH.2 using only the necessary door (D6) without passing through any unnecessary rooms or doors.
