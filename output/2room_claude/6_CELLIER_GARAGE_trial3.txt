Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll first list out the relevant rooms and door connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Relevant Room and Door Connections:
- CELLIER is connected to HALL via D11
- HALL is connected to PORCHE via D2
- PORCHE is connected to GARAGE via D1

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
1. Start in CELLIER
2. ApproachDoor(11)
3. OpenDoor(11)
4. GoThrough(11) to enter HALL
5. ApproachDoor(2)
6. OpenDoor(2)
7. GoThrough(2) to enter PORCHE
8. ApproachDoor(1)
9. OpenDoor(1)
10. GoThrough(1) to enter GARAGE

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "doorNumber": 11},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "doorNumber": 11},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "doorNumber": 11},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "doorNumber": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "doorNumber": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "doorNumber": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "doorNumber": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "doorNumber": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "doorNumber": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the CELLIER to the GARAGE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
