Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from DEGT to CH.2.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects SEJOUR to Porche
D2: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
D3: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
D4: Connects SEJOUR to DEGT
D5: Connects DEGT to CH.1
D6: Connects DEGT to CH.2
D7: Connects DEGT to BAINS
D8: Connects DEGT to WC

Now, let's create the navigation plan from DEGT to CH.2:

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in DEGT
2. Approach door D6
3. Open door D6
4. Go through door D6 to enter CH.2

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from DEGT to CH.2 using only the necessary doors. The robot will approach door D6, open it, and go through to reach CH.2 directly from DEGT.
