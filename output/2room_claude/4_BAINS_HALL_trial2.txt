Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from BAINS to HALL.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects BAINS to HALL
2. D2: Connects WC to HALL
3. D3: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
4. D4: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
5. D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 2
6. D6: Connects HALL to PORCHE
7. D7: Connects CUISINE to HALL
8. D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
9. D9: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE
10. D10: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE to TERRASSE COUVERTE

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in BAINS
2. Use D1 to go from BAINS to HALL

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from BAINS to HALL using only the necessary door (D1). No unnecessary doors or rooms are included in the path.
