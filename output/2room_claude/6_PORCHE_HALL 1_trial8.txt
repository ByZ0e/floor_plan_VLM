Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll analyze the image, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a detailed navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER
D2: Connects PORCHE to CELLIER
D3: Connects PORCHE to HALL
D4: Connects HALL to WC
D5: Connects HALL to LINGERIE
D6: Connects HALL to BUREAU
D7: Connects HALL to BAINS
D8: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE PARENTS
D9: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
D10: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
D11: Connects CELLIER to HALL
D12: Connects GARAGE1 to HALL 1
D21: Connects PORCHE1 to CELLIER 1
D31: Connects PORCHE1 to HALL1
D41: Connects HALL1 to WC1
D51: Connects HALL1 to LINGERIE1
D61: Connects HALL1 to BUREAU1
D71: Connects HALL1 to BAINS1
D81: Connects HALL1 to CHAMBRE PARENTS1
D91: Connects HALL1 to CHAMBRE ENFANT 21
D101: Connects HALL1 to CHAMBRE ENFANT 11
D111: Connects CELLIER 1 to HALL 1
D13: Connects GARAGE1 to CELLIER 1

Now, I'll provide the step-by-step navigation plan to go from PORCHE to HALL 1:

1. ApproachDoor(D31)
2. OpenDoor(D31)
3. GoThrough(D31)

This simple plan will take you directly from PORCHE1 to HALL1, which is the most efficient route based on the floor plan.

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D31"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D31"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D31"}
  ]
}
```

This plan ensures that you start in the PORCHE (specifically PORCHE1) and arrive at HALL 1 using the most direct route available.
