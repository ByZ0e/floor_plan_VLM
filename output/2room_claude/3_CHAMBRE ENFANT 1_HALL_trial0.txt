Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan based on these connections.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects Garage and Cellier
D2: Connects Cellier and Porche
D3: Connects Porche and Hall
D4: Connects Hall and WC
D5: Connects Hall and Lingerie
D6: Connects Hall and Bureau
D7: Connects Hall and Bains
D8: Connects Hall and Chambre Parents
D9: Connects Hall and Chambre Enfant 2
D10: Connects Hall and Chambre Enfant 1
D11: Connects Cellier and Hall

Now, for the navigation plan from Chambre Enfant 1 to Hall:

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in Chambre Enfant 1
2. Use D10 to enter the Hall

Based on this analysis, here's the JSON format of the final navigation plan:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 10}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from Chambre Enfant 1 to the Hall, using only the necessary door (D10) to reach the destination.
