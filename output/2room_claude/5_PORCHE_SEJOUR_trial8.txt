Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from PORCHE to SEJOUR.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects PORCHE and SEJOUR
- D2: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
- D3: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
- D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
- D5: Connects DEGT and CH.1
- D6: Connects DEGT and CH.2
- D7: Connects DEGT and BAINS
- D8: Connects DEGT and WC
- D9: Connects CH.2 and CH.4 (separates the two halves of the building)
- D10: Connects CELLIER and CELLIER1

Navigation Plan:
To go from PORCHE to SEJOUR, we only need to use one door: D1.

Here's the step-by-step navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D1"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently take you from PORCHE to SEJOUR using the most direct route available according to the floor plan.
