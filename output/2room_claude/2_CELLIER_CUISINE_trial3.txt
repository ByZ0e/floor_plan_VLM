Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the CELLIER to the CUISINE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D2: Connects CELLIER to CUISINE
2. D3: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
3. D1: Connects Porche to SEJOUR
4. D4: Connects SEJOUR to DEGT
5. D5: Connects CH.1 to DEGT
6. D6: Connects CH.2 to DEGT
7. D7: Connects DEGT to BAINS
8. D8: Connects DEGT to WC

Navigation Plan:
To go from CELLIER to CUISINE, we only need to use one door: D2.

Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(2)
2. OpenDoor(2)
3. GoThrough(2)

Now, I'll present this plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CELLIER",
  "end": "CUISINE",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from the CELLIER to the CUISINE using only the necessary door (D2) that connects these two rooms directly.
