Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. Let's start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections based on the image:

Room and Door Connections:
1. Porche - D1 - Sejour
2. Sejour - D3 - Cuisine
3. Sejour - D4 - Degt
4. Degt - D5 - Ch.1
5. Degt - D6 - Ch.2
6. Degt - D7 - Bains
7. Degt - D8 - WC

Now, let's create the navigation plan to go from Porche to Sejour:

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in Porche
2. Use D1 to enter Sejour

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from Porche to Sejour using only the necessary doors. The robot will approach door D1, open it, and go through to reach the Sejour, which is the final destination.
