Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 <-> D10 <-> HALL
2. HALL <-> D9 <-> CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
3. HALL <-> D8 <-> CHAMBRE PARENTS
4. HALL <-> D7 <-> BAINS
5. HALL <-> D6 <-> BUREAU
6. HALL <-> D5 <-> LINGERIE
7. HALL <-> D4 <-> WC
8. HALL <-> D3 <-> PORCHE
9. PORCHE <-> D2 <-> CELLIER
10. CELLIER <-> D1 <-> GARAGE
11. CELLIER <-> D11 <-> HALL

Navigation Plan:
To go from CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 to HALL, we only need to use one door. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(10)
2. OpenDoor(10)
3. GoThrough(10)

This sequence will take the robot from CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 directly into the HALL.

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CHAMBRE ENFANT 1",
  "end": "HALL",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 10}
  ]
}
```

This is the most efficient path from CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 to HALL, using only the necessary door (D10) to reach the destination.
