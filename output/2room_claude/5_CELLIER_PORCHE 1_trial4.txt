Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the CELLIER to PORCHE 1.

Room and Door Connections:
- D10: Connects CELLIER and CUISINE
- D2: Connects CUISINE and SEJOUR
- D3: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
- D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
- D8: Connects DEGT and WC
- D7: Connects DEGT and BAINS
- D6: Connects DEGT and CH.2
- D5: Connects DEGT and CH.1
- D1: Connects SEJOUR and Porche
- D11: Connects SEJOUR1 and Porche1
- D31: Connects SEJOUR1 and CUISINE1
- D41: Connects SEJOUR1 and DEGT1
- D81: Connects DEGT1 and WC1
- D71: Connects DEGT1 and BAINS1
- D61: Connects DEGT1 and CH.4
- D51: Connects DEGT1 and CH.3
- D21: Connects CUISINE1 and CELLIER1
- D9: Connects CH.2 and CH.4

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in CELLIER
2. Use D10 to enter CUISINE
3. Use D2 to enter SEJOUR
4. Use D11 to reach PORCHE1

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D11"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from CELLIER to PORCHE1 using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
