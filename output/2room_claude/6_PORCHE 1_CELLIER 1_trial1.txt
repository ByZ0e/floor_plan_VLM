Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll start by listing the relevant rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Relevant Room and Door Connections:
- PORCHE1 <-> D21 <-> CELLIER1
- CELLIER1 <-> D111 <-> HALL1

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
1. Start in PORCHE1
2. ApproachDoor(D21)
3. OpenDoor(D21)
4. GoThrough(D21) to enter CELLIER1

The navigation is complete as we have reached the destination CELLIER1.

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D21"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D21"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D21"}
  ]
}
```

This path is the most efficient route from PORCHE1 to CELLIER1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or actions.
