Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list the rooms and door connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan from CUISINE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE 1.

Room and Door Connections:
- D71: Connects CUISINE 1 and HALL 1
- D81: Connects CUISINE 1 and TERRASSE COUVERTE 1

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
1. Start in CUISINE 1
2. ApproachDoor(D81)
3. OpenDoor(D81)
4. GoThrough(D81)

This plan takes you directly from CUISINE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE 1 using the most efficient path.

JSON format of the final path:

```json
{
  "start": "CUISINE 1",
  "end": "TERRASSE COUVERTE 1",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D81"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D81"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D81"}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan is the most direct and efficient route from CUISINE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE 1, using only the necessary door (D81) that connects these two areas directly.
