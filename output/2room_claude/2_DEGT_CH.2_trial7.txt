Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from DEGT to CH.2.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
D5: Connects CH.1 and DEGT
D6: Connects DEGT and CH.2
D7: Connects DEGT and BAINS
D8: Connects DEGT and WC

Based on these connections, here's the navigation plan to get from DEGT to CH.2:

1. ApproachDoor(6)
2. OpenDoor(6)
3. GoThrough(6)

The plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "DEGT",
  "end": "CH.2",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6}
  ]
}
```

This is the most efficient path from DEGT to CH.2, using only the necessary door (D6) that directly connects these two rooms. No other doors or rooms need to be traversed for this particular navigation task.
