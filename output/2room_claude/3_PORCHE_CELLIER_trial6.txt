Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the PORCHE to the CELLIER.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects PORCHE and CELLIER
- D2: Connects PORCHE and CELLIER
- D3: Connects PORCHE and HALL
- D4: Connects HALL and WC
- D5: Connects HALL and BUREAU
- D6: Connects HALL and BAINS
- D7: Connects HALL and HALL (near CHAMBRE PARENTS)
- D8: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE PARENTS
- D9: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
- D10: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
- D11: Connects HALL and CELLIER

Navigation Plan:
To go from the PORCHE to the CELLIER, we can use either D1 or D2. Since D1 is closer to the PORCHE label, we'll use that for our plan.

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in the PORCHE
2. Approach D1
3. Open D1
4. Go through D1 to enter the CELLIER

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the PORCHE to the CELLIER using only the necessary doors.
