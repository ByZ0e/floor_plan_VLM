Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from the CELLIER to the GARAGE.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
D2: Connects HALL to WC
D3: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
D4: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 2
D6: Connects HALL to PORCHE
D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE
D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE
D10: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE to TERRASSE

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in CELLIER
2. Approach door D9
3. Open door D9
4. Go through door D9 to enter GARAGE

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from the CELLIER to the GARAGE using only the necessary doors. The robot will approach door D9, which directly connects the CELLIER to the GARAGE, open it, and go through to reach the destination.
