Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the CUISINE to the SEJOUR.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects SEJOUR to Porche
2. D2: Connects CUISINE to CELLIER
3. D3: Connects upper CUISINE to lower CUISINE
4. D4: Connects SEJOUR to DEGT
5. D5: Connects CH.1 to DEGT
6. D6: Connects CH.2 to DEGT
7. D7: Connects BAINS to DEGT
8. D8: Connects WC to DEGT

To navigate from CUISINE to SEJOUR:

1. Starting in CUISINE
2. ApproachDoor(D3)
3. OpenDoor(D3)
4. GoThrough(D3)
5. ApproachDoor(D4)
6. OpenDoor(D4)
7. GoThrough(D4)

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CUISINE",
  "end": "SEJOUR",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently guide you from the CUISINE to the SEJOUR using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
