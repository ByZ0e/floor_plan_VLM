Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from the PORCHE to the SEJOUR.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects PORCHE and SEJOUR
2. D2 connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
3. D3 connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
4. D4 connects SEJOUR and DEGT
5. D5 connects CH.1 and DEGT
6. D6 connects DEGT and CH.2
7. D7 connects DEGT and BAINS
8. D8 connects DEGT and WC

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in PORCHE
2. ApproachDoor(1)
3. OpenDoor(1)
4. GoThrough(1)

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "PORCHE",
  "end": "SEJOUR",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the PORCHE to the SEJOUR, using only the necessary door (D1) to reach the destination. No unnecessary rooms or doors are included in the path.
