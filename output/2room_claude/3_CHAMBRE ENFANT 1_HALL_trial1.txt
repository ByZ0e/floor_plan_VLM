Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 to the HALL.

Room and Door Connections:
D10: Connects CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 to HALL
D9: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
D8: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE PARENTS
D7: Connects HALL to BAINS
D6: Connects HALL to BUREAU
D5: Connects HALL to LINGERIE
D4: Connects HALL to WC
D3: Connects HALL to PORCHE
D2: Connects PORCHE to CELLIER
D1: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE
D11: Connects CELLIER to HALL

Navigation Plan:
To go from CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 to HALL, we only need to use one door:

1. ApproachDoor(10)
2. OpenDoor(10)
3. GoThrough(10)

This sequence will take the robot from CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 directly into the HALL, which is the destination.

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 10}
  ]
}
```

This is the most efficient path to reach the HALL from CHAMBRE ENFANT 1, using only the necessary door and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
