Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from CELLIER to PORCHE 1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D10: Connects CELLIER and PORCHE1
2. D2: Connects CELLIER and CUISINE
3. D3: Connects CUISINE and SEJOUR
4. D1: Connects SEJOUR and Porche
5. D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
6. D8: Connects DEGT and WC
7. D7: Connects DEGT and BAINS
8. D5: Connects DEGT and CH.1
9. D6: Connects DEGT and CH.2
10. D9: Connects CH.2 and CH.4
11. D11: Connects PORCHE1 and SEJOUR1
12. D21: Connects PORCHE1 and CELLIER1
13. D31: Connects SEJOUR1 and CUISINE1
14. D41: Connects SEJOUR1 and DEGT1
15. D51: Connects DEGT1 and CH.3
16. D61: Connects DEGT1 and CH.4
17. D71: Connects DEGT1 and BAINS1
18. D81: Connects DEGT1 and WC1

Navigation Plan:
To go from CELLIER to PORCHE1, we only need to use one door:

1. ApproachDoor(10)
2. OpenDoor(10)
3. GoThrough(10)

This is the most efficient path as there is a direct connection between CELLIER and PORCHE1 through door D10.

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CELLIER",
  "end": "PORCHE1",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 10}
  ]
}
```

This plan ensures the robot takes the most direct and efficient route from CELLIER to PORCHE1 using only the necessary door.
