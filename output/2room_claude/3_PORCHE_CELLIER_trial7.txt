Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the connections and provide a navigation plan as requested.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects PORCHE and CELLIER
D2: Connects PORCHE and CELLIER
D3: Connects PORCHE and HALL
D4: Connects HALL and WC
D5: Connects HALL and BUREAU
D6: Connects HALL and BAINS
D7: Connects HALL and HALL (near CHAMBRE PARENTS)
D8: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE PARENTS
D9: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
D10: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
D11: Connects HALL and CELLIER

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in PORCHE
2. Use D2 to enter CELLIER

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "PORCHE",
  "end": "CELLIER",
  "steps": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient path from the PORCHE to the CELLIER using only the necessary doors.
