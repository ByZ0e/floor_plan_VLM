Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the CELLIER to the GARAGE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D9: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE
2. D1: Connects HALL to CELLIER
3. D2: Connects HALL to WC
4. D3: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
5. D4: Connects HALL areas
6. D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 2
7. D6: Connects HALL to PORCHE
8. D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE
9. D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
10. D10: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE to exterior TERRASSE

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in CELLIER
2. Use D9 to go directly from CELLIER to GARAGE

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CELLIER",
  "end": "GARAGE",
  "actions": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"}
  ]
}
```

This is the most efficient path from the CELLIER to the GARAGE, using only the necessary door (D9) that directly connects these two rooms.
