Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from PORCHE 1 to CELLIER 1.

Room and Door Connections:
D21: Connects PORCHE1 and CELLIER 1
D31: Connects PORCHE1 and HALL1
D41: Connects HALL1 and WC1
D51: Connects HALL1 and LINGERIE1
D61: Connects HALL1 and BUREAU1
D71: Connects HALL1 and BAINS1
D81: Connects HALL1 and CHAMBRE PARENTS1
D91: Connects HALL1 and CHAMBRE ENFANT 21
D101: Connects HALL1 and CHAMBRE ENFANT 11
D111: Connects CELLIER 1 and HALL1
D13: Connects GARAGE1 and CELLIER 1

Navigation Plan:
To go from PORCHE1 to CELLIER 1, we only need to use one door:

1. ApproachDoor(21)
2. OpenDoor(21)
3. GoThrough(21)

This is the most direct and efficient path from PORCHE1 to CELLIER 1 based on the floor plan provided.

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "PORCHE1",
  "end": "CELLIER 1",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 21},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 21},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 21}
  ]
}
```

This plan ensures that you'll reach CELLIER 1 from PORCHE1 using the most direct route available according to the floor plan.
