Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D71 connects CUISINE1 and HALL1
2. D81 connects CUISINE1 and TERRASSE COUVERTE 1

Step-by-step Solution:
Starting in CUISINE1, we need to go through D81 to reach TERRASSE COUVERTE 1. This is a direct path that doesn't require going through any other rooms or doors.

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 81},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 81},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 81}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from CUISINE1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE 1 using the most direct path available according to the floor plan.
