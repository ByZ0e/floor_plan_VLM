Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER
D2: Connects GARAGE and PORCHE
D3: Connects PORCHE and HALL
D4: Connects HALL and WC
D5: Connects HALL and LINGERIE
D6: Connects HALL and BUREAU
D7: Connects HALL and BAINS
D8: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE PARENTS
D9: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
D10: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
D11: Connects CELLIER and HALL
D12: Connects GARAGE1 and HALL1 (upper floor)

For the navigation task from CELLIER to HALL, we only need to use one door:

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CELLIER
2. Approach door D11
3. Open door D11
4. Go through door D11 to enter HALL

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D11"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D11"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D11"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from CELLIER to HALL using only the necessary door D11.
