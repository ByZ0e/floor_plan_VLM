Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from BAINS to HALL.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects BAINS to HALL
D2: Connects WC to HALL
D3: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
D4: Connects HALL to HALL (different sections)
D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 2
D6: Connects HALL to PORCHE
D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE
D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE
D10: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE to TERRASSE COUVERTE (exterior)

Step-by-step Solution:
1. Start in BAINS
2. Use D1 to enter HALL

Final Navigation Plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "BAINS",
  "end": "HALL",
  "plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D1"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient path from BAINS to HALL, using only the necessary door (D1) to complete the navigation task.
