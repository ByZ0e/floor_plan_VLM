Thank you for providing the floor plan image. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from CELLIER to PORCHE 1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D10: Connects CELLIER and PORCHE1
2. D2: Connects CELLIER and CUISINE
3. D3: Connects CUISINE and SEJOUR
4. D8: Connects CUISINE and DEGT
5. D7: Connects DEGT and BAINS
6. D6: Connects DEGT and CH.2
5. D5: Connects DEGT and CH.1
6. D4: Connects CH.1 and SEJOUR
7. D1: Connects SEJOUR and PORCHE

Navigation Plan:
To go from CELLIER to PORCHE 1, the most direct route is through door D10. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(10)
2. OpenDoor(10)
3. GoThrough(10)

This plan takes you directly from CELLIER to PORCHE 1 using the connecting door D10.

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CELLIER",
  "end": "PORCHE 1",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 10}
  ]
}
```

This is the most efficient path from CELLIER to PORCHE 1 based on the provided floor plan, using only the necessary doors for traversal.
