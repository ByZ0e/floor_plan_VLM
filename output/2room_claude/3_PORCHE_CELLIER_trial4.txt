Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the PORCHE to the CELLIER.

Room and Door Connections:
1. PORCHE connects to HALL via D2 and to CELLIER via D1
2. HALL connects to PORCHE via D2, to CELLIER via D3, and to WC via D4
3. CELLIER connects to PORCHE via D1 and to HALL via D3
4. WC connects to HALL via D4
5. LINGERIE connects to HALL via D5
6. BUREAU connects to HALL via D6
7. BAINS connects to HALL via D7
8. CHAMBRE PARENTS connects to HALL via D8
9. CHAMBRE ENFANT 2 connects to HALL via D9
10. CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 connects to HALL via D10
11. CELLIER (lower) connects to HALL via D11

Now, let's create the navigation plan from PORCHE to CELLIER:

{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}

This plan takes you directly from the PORCHE to the CELLIER using the most efficient route. The plan involves only one door (D1) which directly connects these two areas.
