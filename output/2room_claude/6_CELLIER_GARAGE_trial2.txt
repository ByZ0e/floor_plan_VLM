Thank you for providing the floor plan image and the navigation task. I'll first list out the relevant room and door connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from the CELLIER to the GARAGE.

Relevant Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE
- D11: Connects CELLIER to HALL

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
1. Start in CELLIER
2. Approach door D1
3. Open door D1
4. Go through door D1 to enter GARAGE

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from the CELLIER to the GARAGE using only the necessary doors. The robot will approach door D1, open it, and go through to reach the GARAGE, completing the navigation task.
