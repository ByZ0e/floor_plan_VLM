Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from the HALL to the PORCHE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects CELLIER and HALL
2. D2: Connects BAINS and HALL
3. D3: Connects WC and HALL
4. D4: Connects CHAMBRE 1 and HALL
5. D5: Connects CHAMBRE 2 and HALL
6. D6: Connects HALL and PORCHE
7. D7: Connects HALL and CUISINE
8. D8: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
9. D9: Connects CELLIER and GARAGE

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in the HALL
2. Approach door D6
3. Open door D6
4. Go through door D6 to reach the PORCHE

The most efficient path from the HALL to the PORCHE is straightforward, as they are directly connected by door D6. Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from the HALL to the PORCHE, using only the necessary door (D6) for traversal.
