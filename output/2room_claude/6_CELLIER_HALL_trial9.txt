Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll first list the relevant rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Relevant Room and Door Connections:
- CELLIER is connected to HALL via door D11
- HALL is connected to PORCHE via door D2
- PORCHE is connected to HALL via door D3

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
1. Start in CELLIER
2. Approach door D11
3. Open door D11
4. Go through door D11 to enter HALL

The navigation is complete as we have reached the HALL from the CELLIER.

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D11"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from the CELLIER to the HALL using only the necessary doors.
