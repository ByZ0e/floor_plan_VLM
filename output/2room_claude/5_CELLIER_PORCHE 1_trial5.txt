Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms, doors, and their connections, then provide a navigation plan from CELLIER to PORCHE 1.

Explicit Room and Door Connections:
D10: Connects CELLIER and PORCHE1
D2: Connects CELLIER and CUISINE
D3: Connects CUISINE and SEJOUR
D1: Connects SEJOUR and PORCHE

Navigation Plan:

1. We start in CELLIER
2. To reach PORCHE 1, we need to go through door D10

Here's the step-by-step navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D10"}
  ]
}
```

This plan takes you directly from CELLIER to PORCHE 1 using the most efficient path available. The plan uses only the necessary door (D10) to reach the destination without any unnecessary detours or additional rooms.
