Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the HALL to the PORCHE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects CELLIER and HALL
2. D2: Connects HALL and BAINS
3. D3: Connects HALL and WC
4. D4: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 1
5. D5: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 2
6. D6: Connects HALL and PORCHE
7. D7: Connects HALL and CUISINE
8. D8: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
9. D9: Connects CELLIER and GARAGE

Step-by-step navigation plan:
Starting from the HALL, we need to reach the PORCHE. Based on the floor plan and the door connections, we can see that there's a direct connection between the HALL and PORCHE through door D6.

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 6
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 6
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 6
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently guide you from the HALL to the PORCHE using the most direct route available.
