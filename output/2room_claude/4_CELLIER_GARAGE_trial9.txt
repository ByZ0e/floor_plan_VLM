Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the connections and provide a navigation plan as requested. Let's start by listing the relevant rooms and doors with their connections:

Room and Door Connections:
- CELLIER is connected to HALL via door D9
- HALL is connected to GARAGE via door D1
- HALL is connected to CHAMBRE 2 via door D5
- HALL is connected to CUISINE via door D6
- HALL is connected to CHAMBRE 1 via door D4
- HALL is connected to WC via door D2

Now, let's create the navigation plan to go from CELLIER to GARAGE:

1. ApproachDoor(D9)
2. OpenDoor(D9)
3. GoThrough(D9)
4. ApproachDoor(D1)
5. OpenDoor(D1)
6. GoThrough(D1)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from CELLIER to GARAGE using only the necessary doors. The robot will start in CELLIER, go through door D9 to enter the HALL, and then use door D1 to reach the GARAGE.
