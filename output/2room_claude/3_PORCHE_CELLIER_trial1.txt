Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the connections and create a navigation plan for you to move from the PORCHE to the CELLIER. Let's start by listing the relevant rooms and doors with their connections:

Room and Door Connections:
- PORCHE is connected to HALL via D3
- HALL is connected to CELLIER via D2
- CELLIER is connected to GARAGE via D1

Now, let's create the step-by-step navigation plan:

1. Start in PORCHE
2. ApproachDoor(D3)
3. OpenDoor(D3)
4. GoThrough(D3) to enter HALL
5. ApproachDoor(D2)
6. OpenDoor(D2)
7. GoThrough(D2) to enter CELLIER

This plan takes you from the PORCHE to the CELLIER using the most direct route based on the available doors.

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates you from the PORCHE to the CELLIER using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
