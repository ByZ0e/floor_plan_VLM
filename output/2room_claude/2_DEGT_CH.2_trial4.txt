Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from DEGT to CH.2.

Room and Door Connections:
D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
D5: Connects DEGT and CH.1
D6: Connects DEGT and CH.2
D7: Connects DEGT and BAINS
D8: Connects DEGT and WC

Navigation Plan:
Starting from DEGT, we need to reach CH.2. Based on the floor plan, we can see that there's a direct connection between DEGT and CH.2 through door D6.

Step-by-step solution:
1. We are already in DEGT
2. Approach door D6
3. Open door D6
4. Go through door D6 to enter CH.2

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D6"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D6"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D6"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from DEGT to CH.2 using only the necessary doors and actions.
