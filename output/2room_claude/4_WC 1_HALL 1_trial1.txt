Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Explicit Room and Door Connections:
D21: Connects WC 1 to HALL 1
D31: Connects CHAMBRE 4 to HALL 1
D41: Connects CHAMBRE 4 to HALL 1
D51: Connects CHAMBRE 3 to HALL 1
D61: Connects HALL 1 to PORCHE 1
D71: Connects CUISINE 1 to HALL 1
D81: Connects CUISINE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE 1
D91: Connects CELLIER 1 to GARAGE 1

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
Starting point: WC 1
End point: HALL 1

The most efficient path to reach HALL 1 from WC 1 is:

1. ApproachDoor(D21)
2. OpenDoor(D21)
3. GoThrough(D21)

This simple sequence of actions will take you directly from WC 1 to HALL 1, which is the most efficient route given the floor plan.

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D21"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D21"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D21"}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan ensures that you reach your destination (HALL 1) from your starting point (WC 1) using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
