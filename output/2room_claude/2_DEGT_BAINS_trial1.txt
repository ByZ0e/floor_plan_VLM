Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a detailed navigation plan from DEGT to BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D4 connects SEJOUR and DEGT
2. D5 connects DEGT and CH.1
3. D6 connects DEGT and CH.2
4. D7 connects DEGT and BAINS
8. D8 connects DEGT and WC

Step-by-step solution:
Starting from DEGT, we need to reach BAINS. Looking at the floor plan, we can see that there's a direct connection between DEGT and BAINS through door D7.

Here's the efficient navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "doorNumber": 7
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "doorNumber": 7
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "doorNumber": 7
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from DEGT to BAINS using the most direct path available.
