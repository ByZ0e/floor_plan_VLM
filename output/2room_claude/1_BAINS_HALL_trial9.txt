Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from BAINS to HALL.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects CELLIER and HALL
D2: Connects BAINS and HALL
D3: Connects WC and HALL
D4: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 1
D5: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 2
D6: Connects HALL and PORCHE
D7: Connects HALL and CUISINE
D8: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Connects CELLIER and GARAGE

Now, for the navigation plan from BAINS to HALL:

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in BAINS
2. Use D2 to go from BAINS to HALL

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2}
  ]
}
```

This plan is the most efficient route from BAINS to HALL, using only the necessary door (D2) to reach the destination. No unnecessary rooms or doors are included in the path.
