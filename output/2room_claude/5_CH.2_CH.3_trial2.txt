Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from CH.2 to CH.3.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D3 connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
2. D4 connects SEJOUR and DEGT
3. D5 connects DEGT and CH.1
4. D6 connects DEGT and CH.2
7. D8 connects DEGT and WC
8. D9 connects CH.2 and CH.3
9. D41 connects SEJOUR1 and DEGT1
10. D51 connects DEGT1 and CH.3

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CH.2
2. Use D9 to go from CH.2 to CH.3

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 9}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from CH.2 to CH.3 using only the necessary doors.
