Thank you for providing the floor plan image and the navigation task. Let me first list out the rooms and doors with their connections based on the image, and then I'll provide the navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CELLIER - connected to CUISINE via D2
2. CUISINE - connected to SEJOUR via D3
3. SEJOUR - connected to DEGT via D4
4. DEGT - connected to CH.1 via D5
5. DEGT - connected to CH.2 via D6
6. DEGT - connected to BAINS via D7
7. DEGT - connected to WC via D8
8. PORCHE - connected to SEJOUR via D1

Now, for the navigation task from CELLIER to CUISINE, here's the step-by-step plan:

1. Start in CELLIER
2. ApproachDoor(D2)
3. OpenDoor(D2)
4. GoThrough(D2)

This sequence will take you directly from CELLIER to CUISINE using the most efficient path.

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CELLIER",
  "end": "CUISINE",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"}
  ]
}
```

This plan uses only the necessary door (D2) to navigate from CELLIER to CUISINE in the most direct and efficient manner, avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
