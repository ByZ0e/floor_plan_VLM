Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from DEGT to BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
2. D5: Connects DEGT and CH.1
3. D6: Connects DEGT and CH.2
4. D7: Connects DEGT and BAINS
8. D8: Connects DEGT and WC

Based on these connections, here's the step-by-step navigation plan from DEGT to BAINS:

1. Start in DEGT
2. ApproachDoor(D7)
3. OpenDoor(D7)
4. GoThrough(D7)

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "DEGT",
  "end": "BAINS",
  "actions": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from DEGT to BAINS using only the necessary doors and actions.
