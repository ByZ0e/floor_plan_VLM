Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from the PORCHE to the CELLIER.

Explicit Room and Door Connections:
D1: PORCHE <-> CELLIER
D2: PORCHE <-> CELLIER
D3: PORCHE <-> HALL
D4: HALL <-> WC
D5: HALL <-> BUREAU
D6: HALL <-> BAINS
D7: HALL <-> HALL
D8: HALL <-> CHAMBRE PARENTS
D9: HALL <-> CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
D10: HALL <-> CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
D11: CELLIER <-> HALL

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in PORCHE
2. Use D2 to enter CELLIER

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from the PORCHE to the CELLIER using only the necessary doors.
