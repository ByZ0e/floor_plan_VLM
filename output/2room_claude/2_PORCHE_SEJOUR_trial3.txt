Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan from PORCHE to SEJOUR.

Rooms and Doors:
1. PORCHE: Connected to SEJOUR via D1
2. CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE via D2
3. SEJOUR: Connected to PORCHE via D1, to CUISINE via D3, to DEGT via D4
4. CUISINE: Connected to CELLIER via D2, to SEJOUR via D3
5. CH.1: Connected to DEGT via D5
6. CH.2: Connected to DEGT via D6
7. DEGT: Connected to SEJOUR via D4, to CH.1 via D5, to CH.2 via D6, to BAINS via D7
8. BAINS: Connected to DEGT via D7, to WC via D8
9. WC: Connected to BAINS via D8

Navigation Plan:
To go from PORCHE to SEJOUR, we only need to use one door: D1.

Here's the step-by-step plan:
1. ApproachDoor(1)
2. OpenDoor(1)
3. GoThrough(1)

The final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from PORCHE to SEJOUR using the most direct route available according to the floor plan.
