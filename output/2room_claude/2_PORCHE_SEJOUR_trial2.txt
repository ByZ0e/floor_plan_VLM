Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the PORCHE to the SEJOUR.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

Rooms:
1. PORCHE
2. SEJOUR (multiple areas)
3. CUISINE (two areas)
4. CELLIER
5. CH.1 (two areas)
6. CH.2 (multiple areas)
7. DEGT (Dégagement, likely a hallway or landing)
8. WC
9. BAINS

Doors and their connections:
D1: Connects PORCHE and SEJOUR
D2: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE (upper area)
D3: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE (lower area)
D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
D5: Connects CH.1 and DEGT
D6: Connects CH.2 and DEGT
D7: Connects BAINS and DEGT
D8: Connects WC and DEGT

Navigation Plan:
To go from PORCHE to SEJOUR, we only need to use one door: D1.

Here's the step-by-step navigation plan:

1. ApproachDoor(1)
2. OpenDoor(1)
3. GoThrough(1)

Now, let's present this in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the PORCHE to the SEJOUR using the most direct path available.
