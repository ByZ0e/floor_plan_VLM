Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan for you to move from DEGT to CH.2.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects SEJOUR and Porche
D2: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
D3: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
D5: Connects DEGT and CH.1
D6: Connects DEGT and CH.2
D7: Connects DEGT and BAINS
D8: Connects DEGT and WC

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in DEGT
2. ApproachDoor(6)
3. OpenDoor(6)
4. GoThrough(6)

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "DEGT",
  "end": "CH.2",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient path from DEGT to CH.2 using only the necessary doors. The robot will approach Door 6, open it, and go through to reach CH.2 directly from DEGT.
