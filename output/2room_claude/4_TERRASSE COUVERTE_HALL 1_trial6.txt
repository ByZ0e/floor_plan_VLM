Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to HALL 1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D10: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE to TERRASSE COUVERTE 1
2. D8: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE to CUISINE
3. D7: Connects CUISINE to HALL
4. D6: Connects HALL to PORCHE
5. D61: Connects PORCHE 1 to HALL1

Navigation Plan:
To get from TERRASSE COUVERTE to HALL 1, we need to go through the following doors in order: D8, D7, D6, and D61.

Here's the step-by-step navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D61"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently guide you from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to HALL 1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
