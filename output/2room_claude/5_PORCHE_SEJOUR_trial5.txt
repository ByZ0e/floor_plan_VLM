Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from PORCHE to SEJOUR.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects PORCHE to SEJOUR
2. D2: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
3. D3: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
4. D4: Connects SEJOUR to DEGT
5. D5: Connects DEGT to CH.1
6. D6: Connects DEGT to CH.2
7. D7: Connects DEGT to BAINS
8. D8: Connects DEGT to WC

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in PORCHE
2. ApproachDoor(D1)
3. OpenDoor(D1)
4. GoThrough(D1)

This plan will take you directly from PORCHE to SEJOUR using the most efficient path.

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "PORCHE",
  "end": "SEJOUR",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"}
  ]
}
```

This plan is the most direct and efficient route from PORCHE to SEJOUR, using only the necessary door (D1) to complete the task.
