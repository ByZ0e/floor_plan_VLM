Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the connections and provide a navigation plan as requested.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D31: Connects SEJOUR1 and CUISINE1
D41: Connects SEJOUR1 and DEGT1
D51: Connects DEGT1 and CH.3
D61: Connects DEGT1 and CH.4
D71: Connects DEGT1 and BAINS1

Based on these connections, here's the step-by-step navigation plan to go from DEGT1 to CH.4:

1. ApproachDoor(D61)
2. OpenDoor(D61)
3. GoThrough(D61)

This is the most direct and efficient path from DEGT1 to CH.4 using only the necessary doors.

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D61"}
  ]
}
```

This plan ensures that you start in DEGT1 and arrive at CH.4 using the most direct route available based on the door connections provided in the floor plan.
