Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects Porche to Sejour
2. D2 connects Sejour to Cuisine
3. D3 connects Sejour to Cuisine
4. D4 connects Sejour to Degt
5. D5 connects Degt to CH.1
6. D6 connects Degt to CH.2
7. D7 connects Degt to Bains
8. D8 connects Degt to WC
9. D9 connects CH.2 to CH.4 (on the right side)
10. D10 connects Cellier to Cuisine (on the right side)

Navigation Plan:
To go from Porche to Sejour, we only need to use one door: D1.

Step-by-step solution:
1. ApproachDoor(1)
2. OpenDoor(1)
3. GoThrough(1)

The final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "Porche",
  "end": "Sejour",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from Porche to Sejour using only the necessary door (D1) to reach the destination.
