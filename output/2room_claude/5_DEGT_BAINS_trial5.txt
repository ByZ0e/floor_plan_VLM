Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms, doors, and their connections, then provide you with a navigation plan to get from DEGT to BAINS.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:
1. D1 connects Porche to SEJOUR
2. D2 connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
3. D3 connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
4. D4 connects SEJOUR to DEGT
5. D5 connects DEGT to CH.1
6. D6 connects DEGT to CH.2
7. D7 connects DEGT to BAINS
8. D8 connects DEGT to WC
9. D9 connects CH.2 to CH.4
10. D10 connects CELLIER to CUISINE
11. D11 connects Porche1 to SEJOUR1
12. D21 connects CELLIER1 to CUISINE1
13. D31 connects SEJOUR1 to CUISINE1
14. D41 connects SEJOUR1 to DEGT1
15. D51 connects DEGT1 to CH.3
16. D61 connects DEGT1 to CH.4
17. D71 connects DEGT1 to BAINS1
18. D81 connects DEGT1 to WC1

Navigation Plan:
Starting from DEGT, we need to go through door D7 to reach BAINS. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(7)
2. OpenDoor(7)
3. GoThrough(7)

JSON format of the final path:
```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7}
  ]
}
```

This is the most efficient path from DEGT to BAINS, using only the necessary door (D7) to reach the destination.
