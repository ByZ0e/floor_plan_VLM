Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from the CELLIER to the GARAGE.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
D2: Connects HALL to BAINS
D3: Connects HALL to WC
D4: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 2
D6: Connects HALL to PORCHE
D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE
D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in CELLIER
2. ApproachDoor(D9)
3. OpenDoor(D9)
4. GoThrough(D9)
5. Arrive in GARAGE

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CELLIER",
  "actions": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"}
  ],
  "end": "GARAGE"
}
```

This is the most efficient path from the CELLIER to the GARAGE, using only the necessary door (D9) that directly connects these two rooms.
