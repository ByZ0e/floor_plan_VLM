Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the CUISINE to the SEJOUR.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

1. D1: Connects SEJOUR to Porche
2. D2: Connects CUISINE to CELLIER
3. D3: Connects upper CUISINE to lower CUISINE
4. D4: Connects SEJOUR to DEGT
5. D5: Connects CH.1 to DEGT
6. D6: Connects CH.2 to DEGT
7. D7: Connects BAINS to DEGT
8. D8: Connects WC to DEGT

Navigation Plan:

To move from the CUISINE to the SEJOUR, we need to use door D3. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(3)
2. OpenDoor(3)
3. GoThrough(3)
4. ApproachDoor(3)
5. OpenDoor(3)
6. GoThrough(3)

JSON format of the final path:

```json
{
  "start": "CUISINE",
  "end": "SEJOUR",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates you from the CUISINE to the SEJOUR using only the necessary door (D3) that connects these two areas. The plan accounts for the fact that doors close after each GoThrough action, so we need to open D3 twice to complete the journey.
