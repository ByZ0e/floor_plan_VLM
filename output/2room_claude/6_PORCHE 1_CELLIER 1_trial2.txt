Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from PORCHE 1 to CELLIER 1.

Explicit Door and Room Connections:
D21: Connects PORCHE1 and CELLIER 1
D31: Connects PORCHE1 and HALL1
D41: Connects HALL1 and WC1
D51: Connects HALL1 and LINGERIE1
D61: Connects HALL1 and BUREAU1
D71: Connects HALL1 and BAINS1
D81: Connects HALL1 and CHAMBRE PARENTS1
D91: Connects HALL1 and CHAMBRE ENFANT 21
D101: Connects HALL1 and CHAMBRE ENFANT 11
D111: Connects CELLIER 1 and HALL1
D13: Connects GARAGE1 and CELLIER 1

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in PORCHE1
2. Use D21 to enter CELLIER 1

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "PORCHE1",
  "end": "CELLIER 1",
  "steps": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D21"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D21"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D21"
    }
  ]
}
```

This is the most efficient path from PORCHE1 to CELLIER 1, using only the necessary door (D21) to reach the destination.
