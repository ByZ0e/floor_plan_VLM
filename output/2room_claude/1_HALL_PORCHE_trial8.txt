Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the HALL to the PORCHE.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects CELLIER and HALL
D2: Connects BAINS and HALL
D3: Connects WC and HALL
D4: Connects CHAMBRE 1 and HALL
D5: Connects CHAMBRE 2 and HALL
D6: Connects HALL and PORCHE
D7: Connects HALL and CUISINE
D8: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Connects CELLIER and GARAGE

Navigation Plan:
Starting from the HALL, we need to reach the PORCHE. Based on the floor plan and the door connections, the most direct path is to use door D6, which connects the HALL directly to the PORCHE.

Step-by-step solution:
1. ApproachDoor(6)
2. OpenDoor(6)
3. GoThrough(6)

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the HALL to the PORCHE using only the necessary door (D6) without traversing any unnecessary rooms or doors.
