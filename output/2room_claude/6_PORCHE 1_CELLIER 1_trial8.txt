Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll start by listing the relevant rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Relevant Room and Door Connections:
- PORCHE1 connects to HALL1 via D31
- HALL1 connects to CELLIER1 via D111

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
1. Start in PORCHE1
2. Approach door D31
3. Open door D31
4. Go through door D31 to enter HALL1
5. Approach door D111
6. Open door D111
7. Go through door D111 to enter CELLIER1

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "doorNumber": 31},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "doorNumber": 31},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "doorNumber": 31},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "doorNumber": 111},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "doorNumber": 111},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "doorNumber": 111}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from PORCHE1 to CELLIER1 using only the necessary doors. The robot will start in PORCHE1, go through D31 to enter HALL1, and then through D111 to reach the final destination of CELLIER1.
