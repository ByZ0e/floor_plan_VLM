Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from DEGT 1 to CH.4.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D31: Connects SEJOUR1 and CUISINE1
2. D41: Connects SEJOUR1 and DEGT1
3. D51: Connects DEGT1 and CH.3
4. D61: Connects DEGT1 and CH.4
5. D71: Connects DEGT1 and BAINS1

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in DEGT1
2. ApproachDoor(D61)
3. OpenDoor(D61)
4. GoThrough(D61)

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "DEGT1",
  "end": "CH.4",
  "steps": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D61"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from DEGT1 to CH.4 using only the necessary doors. The robot will approach door D61, which connects DEGT1 directly to CH.4, open it, and go through to reach the destination.
