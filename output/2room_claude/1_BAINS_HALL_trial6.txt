Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects CELLIER and HALL
- D2: Connects BAINS and HALL
- D3: Connects WC and HALL
- D4: Connects CHAMBRE 1 and HALL
- D5: Connects CHAMBRE 2 and HALL
- D6: Connects HALL and PORCHE
- D7: Connects HALL and CUISINE
- D8: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
- D9: Connects CELLIER and GARAGE

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in BAINS
2. Use D2 to enter HALL

Since we're starting in BAINS and our goal is to reach HALL, we only need to use one door (D2) to complete this task.

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from BAINS to HALL using only the necessary door (D2) without any unnecessary steps or rooms.
