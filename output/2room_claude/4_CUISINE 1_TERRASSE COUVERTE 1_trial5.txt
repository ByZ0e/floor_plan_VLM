Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from CUISINE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE 1.

Room and Door Connections:
- D71: Connects CUISINE 1 and HALL1
- D81: Connects CUISINE 1 and TERRASSE COUVERTE 1
- D61: Connects HALL1 and PORCHE 1
- D51: Connects HALL1 and CHAMBRE 3
- D41: Connects HALL1 and CHAMBRE 4
- D31: Connects HALL1 and WC 1
- D21: Connects HALL1 and BAINS 1
- D11: Connects HALL1 and CELLIER 1
- D91: Connects CELLIER 1 and GARAGE 1

Navigation Plan:
To go from CUISINE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE 1, we only need to use one door: D81.

Step-by-step solution:
1. ApproachDoor(81)
2. OpenDoor(81)
3. GoThrough(81)

Final Navigation Plan in JSON format:
```json
{
  "start": "CUISINE 1",
  "end": "TERRASSE COUVERTE 1",
  "actions": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 81},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 81},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 81}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from CUISINE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE 1 using only the necessary door (D81) that connects these two areas directly.
