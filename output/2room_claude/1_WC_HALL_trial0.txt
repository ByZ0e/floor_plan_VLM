Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a detailed navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects Cellier and Hall
D2: Connects WC and Hall
D3: Connects WC and Hall
D4: Connects Hall and Chambre 1
D5: Connects Hall and Chambre 2
D6: Connects Hall and Porche
D7: Connects Hall and Cuisine
D8: Connects Cuisine and Terrasse Couverte
D9: Connects Cellier and Garage

For the task of navigating from the WC to the Hall, we only need to use one door. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. Start in WC
2. ApproachDoor(D2)
3. OpenDoor(D2)
4. GoThrough(D2)

This sequence will take you directly from the WC to the Hall.

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "WC",
  "end": "HALL",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"}
  ]
}
```

This is the most efficient path from the WC to the Hall, using only the necessary door (D2) to complete the navigation task.
