Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan for you to move from CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 to the HALL.

Room and Door Connections:
D9: Connects CHAMBRE ENFANT 2 to HALL
D10: Connects CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 to HALL
D6: Connects BUREAU to HALL
D5: Connects LINGERIE to HALL
D7: Connects BAINS to HALL
D8: Connects CHAMBRE PARENTS to HALL
D3: Connects PORCHE to HALL
D4: Connects WC to HALL
D1: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER
D2: Connects CELLIER to PORCHE
D11: Connects CELLIER to HALL

Navigation Plan:
To move from CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 to the HALL, the most direct path is:

1. ApproachDoor(10)
2. OpenDoor(10)
3. GoThrough(10)

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CHAMBRE ENFANT 1",
  "end": "HALL",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 10}
  ]
}
```

This is the most efficient path from CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 to the HALL, using only the necessary door (D10) that directly connects these two spaces.
