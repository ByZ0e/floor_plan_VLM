Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll first list the relevant rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Relevant Room and Door Connections:
- PORCHE1 <-> D21 <-> CELLIER 1
- CELLIER 1 <-> D111 <-> HALL 1

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
1. Start in PORCHE1
2. ApproachDoor(D21)
3. OpenDoor(D21)
4. GoThrough(D21) to enter CELLIER 1
5. ApproachDoor(D111)
6. OpenDoor(D111)
7. GoThrough(D111) to enter HALL 1

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "PORCHE1",
  "end": "HALL 1",
  "actions": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D21"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D21"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D21"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D111"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D111"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D111"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from PORCHE1 to HALL 1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
