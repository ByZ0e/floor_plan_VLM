Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from PORCHE 1 to CELLIER 1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D21 connects PORCHE1 and CELLIER 1
2. D31 connects PORCHE1 and HALL1
3. D41 connects HALL1 and WC1
4. D51 connects HALL1 and LINGERIE1
5. D61 connects HALL1 and BUREAU1
6. D71 connects HALL1 and BAINS1
7. D81 connects HALL1 and CHAMBRE PARENTS1
8. D91 connects HALL1 and CHAMBRE ENFANT 21
9. D101 connects HALL1 and CHAMBRE ENFANT 11
10. D111 connects CELLIER 1 and HALL1
11. D13 connects GARAGE1 and CELLIER 1
12. D12 connects HALL1 and PORCHE

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in PORCHE1
2. Use D21 to go directly from PORCHE1 to CELLIER 1

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "PORCHE1",
  "end": "CELLIER 1",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D21"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D21"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D21"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from PORCHE1 to CELLIER 1 using only the necessary door (D21) that connects these two rooms directly.
