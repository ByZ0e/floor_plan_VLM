Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from DEGT to CH.2.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D4 connects SEJOUR and DEGT
2. D5 connects DEGT and CH.1
3. D6 connects DEGT and CH.2
4. D7 connects DEGT and BAINS
5. D8 connects DEGT and WC

Based on these connections, here's the step-by-step navigation plan to go from DEGT to CH.2:

1. Start in DEGT
2. ApproachDoor(D6)
3. OpenDoor(D6)
4. GoThrough(D6)

Now, let's format this as a JSON sequence:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from DEGT to CH.2 using only the necessary doors. The robot will approach door D6, open it, and go through to reach CH.2 directly from DEGT.
