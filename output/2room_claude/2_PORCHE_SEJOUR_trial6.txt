Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the PORCHE to the SEJOUR.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects PORCHE and SEJOUR
2. D2 connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
3. D3 connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
4. D4 connects SEJOUR and DEGT
5. D5 connects CH.1 and DEGT
6. D6 connects DEGT and CH.2
7. D7 connects DEGT and BAINS
8. D8 connects DEGT and WC

Navigation Plan:
To go from PORCHE to SEJOUR, we only need to use one door: D1.

Here's the step-by-step plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently take you from the PORCHE to the SEJOUR using the most direct route available.
