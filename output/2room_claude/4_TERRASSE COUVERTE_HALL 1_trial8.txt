Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to HALL 1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D10: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE to TERRASSE COUVERTE 1
2. D8: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE to CUISINE
3. D7: Connects CUISINE to HALL
4. D6: Connects HALL to PORCHE
5. D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 2
6. D4: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
3. D3: Connects HALL to BAINS
2. D2: Connects HALL to WC
1. D1: Connects HALL to CELLIER
9. D9: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE

For the navigation from TERRASSE COUVERTE to HALL 1, we need to use the following path:
TERRASSE COUVERTE -> D8 -> CUISINE -> D7 -> HALL

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in TERRASSE COUVERTE
2. Approach and go through D8 to enter CUISINE
3. In CUISINE, approach and go through D7 to enter HALL (which is labeled as HALL 1 in the right part of the image)

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D8"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D8"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D8"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D7"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D7"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D7"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to HALL 1 using only the necessary doors and rooms.
