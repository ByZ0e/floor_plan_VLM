Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. Let's start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections based on the image:

Room and Door Connections:
1. TERRASSE COUVERTE - D10 - TERRASSE COUVERTE 1
2. TERRASSE COUVERTE 1 - D81 - CUISINE 1
3. CUISINE 1 - D71 - HALL 1
4. HALL 1 - D61 - PORCHE 1
5. PORCHE 1 - D51 - CHAMBRE 3
6. CHAMBRE 3 - D11 - HALL 1
7. HALL 1 - D21 - WC 1
8. WC 1 - D31 - HALL 1
9. HALL 1 - D41 - CHAMBRE 4
10. HALL 1 - D91 - CELLIER 1
11. CELLIER 1 - D91 - GARAGE 1

Now, let's create a step-by-step navigation plan to go from TERRASSE COUVERTE to HALL 1:

1. ApproachDoor(D10)
2. OpenDoor(D10)
3. GoThrough(D10)
4. ApproachDoor(D81)
5. OpenDoor(D81)
6. GoThrough(D81)
7. ApproachDoor(D71)
8. OpenDoor(D71)
9. GoThrough(D71)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D81"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D81"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D81"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D71"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D71"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D71"}
  ]
}
```

This path takes you from TERRASSE COUVERTE through TERRASSE COUVERTE 1 and CUISINE 1 to finally reach HALL 1. It's the most direct and efficient route based on the floor plan provided.
