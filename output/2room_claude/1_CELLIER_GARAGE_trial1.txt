Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from the CELLIER to the GARAGE.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
D2: Connects BAINS to HALL
D3: Connects WC to HALL
D4: Connects CHAMBRE 1 to HALL
D5: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to HALL
D6: Connects HALL to PORCHE
D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE
D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in CELLIER
2. ApproachDoor(D9)
3. OpenDoor(D9)
4. GoThrough(D9)

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CELLIER",
  "end": "GARAGE",
  "actions": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from the CELLIER to the GARAGE using only the necessary door (D9) that connects these two rooms directly.
