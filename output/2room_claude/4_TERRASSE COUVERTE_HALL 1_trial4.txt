Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to HALL 1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D10 connects TERRASSE COUVERTE to TERRASSE COUVERTE 1
2. D81 connects TERRASSE COUVERTE 1 to CUISINE 1
3. D71 connects CUISINE 1 to HALL 1
4. D61 connects HALL 1 to PORCHE 1
5. D51 connects HALL 1 to CHAMBRE 3
6. D11 connects HALL 1 to BAINS 1
7. D21 connects BAINS 1 to WC 1
8. D31 connects HALL 1 to CHAMBRE 4
9. D41 connects HALL 1 to HALL 1 (different section)
10. D91 connects CELLIER 1 to GARAGE 1

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in TERRASSE COUVERTE
2. Use D10 to enter TERRASSE COUVERTE 1
3. Use D81 to enter CUISINE 1
4. Use D71 to reach HALL 1

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D10"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D10"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D10"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D81"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D81"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D81"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D71"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D71"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D71"
    }
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan will efficiently guide you from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to HALL 1 using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
