Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from CUISINE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE 1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D71 connects CUISINE 1 and HALL1
2. D61 connects HALL1 and PORCHE 1
3. D81 connects CUISINE 1 and TERRASSE COUVERTE 1

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CUISINE 1
2. Use D81 to go directly to TERRASSE COUVERTE 1

Final Navigation Plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CUISINE 1",
  "end": "TERRASSE COUVERTE 1",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D81"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D81"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D81"}
  ]
}
```

This is the most efficient path from CUISINE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE 1, using only the necessary door (D81) that directly connects these two areas. No other doors or rooms need to be traversed for this particular navigation task.
