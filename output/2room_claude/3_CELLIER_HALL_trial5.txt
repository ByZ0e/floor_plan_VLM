Certainly! I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections based on the floor plan image, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan from the CELLIER to the HALL.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER
2. D2: Connects CELLIER and PORCHE
3. D3: Connects PORCHE and HALL
4. D4: Connects HALL and WC
5. D5: Connects HALL and LINGERIE
6. D6: Connects HALL and BUREAU
7. D7: Connects HALL and BAINS
8. D8: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE PARENTS
9. D9: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
10. D10: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
11. D11: Connects CELLIER and HALL

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in the CELLIER
2. Use D11 to go directly from CELLIER to HALL

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 11
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 11
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 11
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from the CELLIER to the HALL using only the necessary doors. The robot will approach, open, and go through door D11, which directly connects the CELLIER to the HALL, completing the navigation task.
