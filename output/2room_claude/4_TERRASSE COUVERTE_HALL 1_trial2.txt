Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to HALL 1.

Room and Door Connections:
D10: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE to TERRASSE COUVERTE 1
D8: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE to CUISINE
D81: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE 1 to CUISINE 1
D7: Connects CUISINE to HALL
D71: Connects CUISINE 1 to HALL 1
D6: Connects HALL to PORCHE
D61: Connects HALL 1 to PORCHE 1

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in TERRASSE COUVERTE
2. Use D8 to enter CUISINE
3. Use D7 to enter HALL
4. Use D6 to enter PORCHE
5. Use D61 to enter PORCHE 1
6. Use D71 to enter CUISINE 1
7. Use D81 to enter TERRASSE COUVERTE 1
8. Use D10 to enter TERRASSE COUVERTE
9. Use D8 to enter CUISINE
10. Use D7 to reach HALL

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from TERRASSE COUVERTE to HALL 1 using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary steps or rooms.
