Thank you for providing the floor plan. Let me analyze the rooms and doors, and then provide you with a navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects Porche and Sejour
- D2: Connects Sejour and Cuisine
- D3: Connects Sejour and Cuisine (lower part)
- D4: Connects Sejour and Degt (Dégagement/Hallway)
- D5: Connects CH.1 and Degt
- D6: Connects Degt and CH.2
- D7: Connects Degt and Bains
- D8: Connects Degt and WC

For your navigation task from Porche to Sejour, we only need to use one door:

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in Porche
2. Approach D1
3. Open D1
4. Go through D1 to enter Sejour

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently guide you from the Porche to the Sejour using the most direct path available. You'll only need to use one door (D1) to complete this navigation task.
