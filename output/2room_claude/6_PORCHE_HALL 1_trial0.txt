Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the connections and provide a navigation plan as requested.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:
D1: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER
D2: Connects PORCHE to CELLIER
D3: Connects PORCHE to HALL
D4: Connects HALL to WC
D5: Connects HALL to LINGERIE
D6: Connects HALL to BUREAU
D7: Connects HALL to BAINS
D8: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE PARENTS
D9: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
D10: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
D11: Connects CELLIER to HALL
D12: Connects HALL to PORCHE1 (upper floor)

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in PORCHE
2. Use D3 to enter HALL
3. HALL is connected to HALL 1 (they are the same space, just labeled differently in different areas)

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from PORCHE to HALL 1 using only the necessary doors. The HALL and HALL 1 appear to be the same continuous space, so once you enter the HALL through door D3, you have reached your destination of HALL 1.
