Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from PORCHE to SEJOUR.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects PORCHE to SEJOUR
2. D2 connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
3. D3 connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
4. D4 connects SEJOUR to DEGT (Dégagement/Hallway)
5. D5 connects DEGT to CH.1
6. D6 connects DEGT to CH.2
7. D7 connects DEGT to BAINS
8. D8 connects DEGT to WC
9. D9 connects CH.2 to CH.4 (on the right side)
10. D10 connects CELLIER to CELLIER1 (top of the plan)

Step-by-step solution:
To navigate from PORCHE to SEJOUR, we only need to use one door: D1.

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D1"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently guide you from the PORCHE to the SEJOUR using only the necessary door (D1) without any unnecessary steps or rooms.
