Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a detailed navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
2. D2 connects CELLIER and CUISINE
3. D3 connects upper CUISINE and lower CUISINE
4. D4 connects SEJOUR and DEGT
5. D5 connects CH.1 and DEGT
6. D6 connects CH.2 and DEGT
7. D7 connects BAINS and DEGT
8. D8 connects WC and DEGT

Now, let's create the navigation plan to go from CUISINE to SEJOUR:

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CUISINE
2. Approach D1
3. Open D1
4. Go through D1 to enter SEJOUR

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from CUISINE to SEJOUR using only the necessary doors. The robot will approach D1, open it, and go through to reach the SEJOUR, completing the navigation task.
