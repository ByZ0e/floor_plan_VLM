Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from DEGT to BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects Porche to SEJOUR
2. D2: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
3. D3: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
4. D4: Connects SEJOUR to DEGT
5. D5: Connects DEGT to CH.1
6. D6: Connects DEGT to CH.2
7. D7: Connects DEGT to BAINS
8. D8: Connects DEGT to WC
9. D9: Connects CH.2 to CH.4
10. D10: Connects CELLIER to CUISINE
11. D11: Connects Porche1 to SEJOUR1
21. D21: Connects CELLIER1 to CUISINE1
31. D31: Connects SEJOUR1 to CUISINE1
41. D41: Connects SEJOUR1 to DEGT1
51. D51: Connects DEGT1 to CH.3
61. D61: Connects DEGT1 to CH.4
71. D71: Connects DEGT1 to BAINS1

Navigation Plan:
Starting from DEGT, we need to reach BAINS. The most direct path is:

1. ApproachDoor(7)
2. OpenDoor(7)
3. GoThrough(7)

This is the most efficient path as DEGT is directly connected to BAINS through door D7.

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7}
  ]
}
```

This plan takes you directly from DEGT to BAINS using the most efficient route available based on the provided floor plan.
