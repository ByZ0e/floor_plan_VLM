Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the WC to the HALL.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects CELLIER and HALL
- D2: Connects WC and HALL
- D3: Connects WC and HALL (another entrance)
- D4: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 1
- D5: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 2
- D6: Connects HALL and PORCHE
- D7: Connects HALL and CUISINE
- D8: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
- D9: Connects CELLIER and GARAGE

Navigation Plan:
To go from the WC to the HALL, we only need to use one door. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(2)
2. OpenDoor(2)
3. GoThrough(2)

This sequence will take you directly from the WC to the HALL using the most efficient path.

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2}
  ]
}
```

This plan ensures that you use only the necessary door (D2) to reach your destination efficiently, avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
