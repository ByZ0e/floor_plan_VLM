Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the CELLIER to the CUISINE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D2 connects CELLIER and CUISINE
2. D1 connects SEJOUR and Porche
3. D3 connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
4. D4 connects SEJOUR and DEGT
5. D5 connects CH.1 and DEGT
6. D6 connects CH.2 and DEGT
7. D7 connects BAINS and DEGT
8. D8 connects WC and DEGT

Step-by-step solution:
To navigate from the CELLIER to the CUISINE, we only need to use one door: D2.

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently guide you from the CELLIER to the CUISINE using the most direct route available.
