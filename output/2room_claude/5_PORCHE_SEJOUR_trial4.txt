Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the connections and provide a navigation plan for you to move from PORCHE to SEJOUR.

Explicit Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects PORCHE to SEJOUR
- D2: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
- D3: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
- D4: Connects SEJOUR to DEGT
- D5: Connects DEGT to CH.1
- D6: Connects DEGT to CH.2
- D7: Connects DEGT to BAINS
- D8: Connects DEGT to WC
- D9: Connects CH.2 to CH.4 (not needed for this navigation)
- D10: Connects CELLIER to CUISINE (not needed for this navigation)

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in PORCHE
2. Use D1 to enter SEJOUR

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "doorNumber": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "doorNumber": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "doorNumber": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from PORCHE to SEJOUR using the most direct path available based on the floor plan provided.
