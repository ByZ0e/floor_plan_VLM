Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. Let's start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections based on the image:

Room and Door Connections:
1. CUISINE 1 <-> D71 <-> HALL1
2. HALL1 <-> D61 <-> PORCHE 1
3. PORCHE 1 <-> D81 <-> TERRASSE COUVERTE 1

Now, let's create the navigation plan to go from CUISINE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE 1:

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CUISINE 1
2. Use D71 to enter HALL1
3. Use D61 to enter PORCHE 1
4. Use D81 to reach TERRASSE COUVERTE 1

Here's the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D71"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D71"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D71"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D81"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D81"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D81"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from CUISINE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE 1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
