Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll start by listing the relevant rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Relevant Room and Door Connections:
- WC 1 connects to HALL 1 via door D21
- HALL 1 connects to CHAMBRE 4 via door D41
- HALL 1 connects to HALL 1 (central area) via door D51

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
1. Start in WC 1
2. Approach door D21
3. Open door D21
4. Go through door D21 to enter HALL 1

The navigation is complete at this point, as we have reached HALL 1, which is the destination.

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D21"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D21"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D21"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from WC 1 to HALL 1 using only the necessary doors and actions. The robot will end up in HALL 1 after executing these steps.
