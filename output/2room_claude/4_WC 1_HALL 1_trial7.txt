Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from WC 1 to HALL 1.

Room and Door Connections:
- D21 connects WC 1 to HALL 1
- D31 connects CHAMBRE 4 to HALL 1
- D41 connects HALL 1 to HALL 1
- D51 connects CHAMBRE 3 to HALL 1
- D61 connects HALL 1 to PORCHE 1
- D71 connects CUISINE 1 to HALL 1
- D81 connects CUISINE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE 1
- D91 connects CELLIER 1 to GARAGE 1

Navigation Plan:
To go from WC 1 to HALL 1, we only need to use one door: D21.

Here's the step-by-step plan:
1. ApproachDoor(21)
2. OpenDoor(21)
3. GoThrough(21)

This sequence will take you directly from WC 1 to HALL 1.

JSON format of the final path:
```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 21},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 21},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 21}
  ]
}
```

This is the most efficient path from WC 1 to HALL 1, using only the necessary door (D21) to reach the destination.
