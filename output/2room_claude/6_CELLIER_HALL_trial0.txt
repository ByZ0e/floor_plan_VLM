Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the CELLIER to the HALL.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER
2. D2: Connects GARAGE to PORCHE
3. D3: Connects PORCHE to HALL
4. D4: Connects HALL to WC
5. D5: Connects HALL to LINGERIE
6. D6: Connects HALL to BUREAU
7. D7: Connects HALL to BAINS
8. D8: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE PARENTS
9. D9: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
10. D10: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
11. D11: Connects CELLIER to HALL
12. D12: Connects upper GARAGE to upper PORCHE (not needed for this navigation)

Step-by-step solution:
Starting in the CELLIER, we need to go through D11 to reach the HALL.

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 11}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate the robot from the CELLIER to the HALL using the most direct route available based on the floor plan provided.
