Thank you for providing the floor plan image. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from CELLIER to PORCHE 1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D10 connects CELLIER and PORCHE1
2. D2 connects CELLIER and CUISINE
3. D3 connects CUISINE and SEJOUR
4. D4 connects SEJOUR and DEGT
5. D5 connects DEGT and CH.1
6. D6 connects DEGT and CH.2
7. D7 connects DEGT and BAINS
8. D8 connects DEGT and WC
9. D9 connects CH.2 and CH.4
10. D1 connects SEJOUR and PORCHE
11. D11 connects PORCHE1 and SEJOUR1
12. D21 connects CELLIER1 and CUISINE1
13. D31 connects CUISINE1 and SEJOUR1
14. D41 connects SEJOUR1 and DEGT1
15. D51 connects DEGT1 and CH.3
16. D61 connects DEGT1 and CH.4
17. D71 connects DEGT1 and BAINS1
18. D81 connects DEGT1 and WC1

Navigation Plan:
To get from CELLIER to PORCHE1, we only need to use one door:

1. ApproachDoor(10)
2. OpenDoor(10)
3. GoThrough(10)

This is the most efficient path as it directly connects CELLIER to PORCHE1.

Here's the plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CELLIER",
  "end": "PORCHE1",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 10}
  ]
}
```

This plan ensures the most direct and efficient route from CELLIER to PORCHE1 using only the necessary door.
