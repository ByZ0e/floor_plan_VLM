Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from WC 1 to HALL 1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. WC 1 <-> D21 <-> HALL 1
2. HALL 1 <-> D31 <-> CHAMBRE 4
3. HALL 1 <-> D41 <-> CHAMBRE 4
4. HALL 1 <-> D51 <-> CHAMBRE 3
5. HALL 1 <-> D61 <-> PORCHE 1
6. HALL 1 <-> D71 <-> CUISINE 1
7. CUISINE 1 <-> D81 <-> TERRASSE COUVERTE 1
8. TERRASSE COUVERTE 1 <-> D91 <-> GARAGE 1
9. TERRASSE COUVERTE 1 <-> D101 <-> TERRASSE COUVERTE 1 (exterior)

Navigation Plan:
To go from WC 1 to HALL 1, we only need to use one door. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(21)
2. OpenDoor(21)
3. GoThrough(21)

This sequence will take you directly from WC 1 to HALL 1.

JSON format of the final path:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 21},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 21},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 21}
  ]
}
```

This is the most efficient and correct path from WC 1 to HALL 1 based on the provided floor plan. No unnecessary doors or rooms are included in this navigation plan.
