Certainly! I'll analyze the floor plan, list the room and door connections, and then provide a detailed navigation plan from the PORCHE to the CELLIER.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER
D2: Connects PORCHE and CELLIER
D3: Connects PORCHE and HALL
D4: Connects HALL and WC
D5: Connects HALL and LINGERIE
D6: Connects HALL and BUREAU
D7: Connects HALL and BAINS
D8: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE PARENTS
D9: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
D10: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
D11: Connects CELLIER and HALL

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in PORCHE
2. Use D2 to enter CELLIER directly

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "PORCHE",
  "end": "CELLIER",
  "steps": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 2
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 2
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 2
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from the PORCHE to the CELLIER using only the necessary door (D2) that connects these two spaces directly.
