Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to the CUISINE.

Room and Door Connections:
D8: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE to CUISINE
D7: Connects CUISINE to HALL
D6: Connects HALL to PORCHE
D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 2
D4: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
D3: Connects HALL to WC
D2: Connects HALL to BAINS
D1: Connects HALL to CELLIER
D9: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. ApproachDoor(8)
2. OpenDoor(8)
3. GoThrough(8)

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to the CUISINE using only the necessary door (D8) that directly connects these two areas. No additional doors or rooms need to be traversed for this particular route.
