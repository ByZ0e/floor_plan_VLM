Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the CELLIER to the GARAGE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CELLIER - D9 - GARAGE
2. CELLIER - D1 - HALL
3. HALL - D2 - WC
4. HALL - D3 - CHAMBRE 1
5. HALL - D4 - HALL
6. HALL - D5 - CHAMBRE 2
7. HALL - D6 - PORCHE
8. PORCHE - D7 - CUISINE
9. CUISINE - D8 - TERRASSE COUVERTE
10. TERRASSE COUVERTE - D10 - TERRASSE COUVERTE

Based on these connections, here's the efficient navigation plan from CELLIER to GARAGE:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"}
  ]
}
```

This plan is the most direct and efficient route from the CELLIER to the GARAGE. It involves only one door (D9) which directly connects these two rooms. There's no need to go through any other rooms or use any other doors in this case.
