Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan from PORCHE to SEJOUR.

Room and Door Connections:
1. PORCHE connects to SEJOUR via D1
2. SEJOUR connects to CUISINE via D3
3. SEJOUR connects to DEGT via D4
4. DEGT connects to CH.1 via D5
5. DEGT connects to CH.2 via D6
6. DEGT connects to BAINS via D7
7. DEGT connects to WC via D8
9. CELLIER connects to CUISINE via D2
10. CELLIER connects to PORCHE via D10

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in PORCHE
2. Use D1 to enter SEJOUR

Final Navigation Plan in JSON format:
```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient path from PORCHE to SEJOUR using only the necessary doors. The robot will approach D1, open it, and go through to reach the SEJOUR, which is the final destination.
