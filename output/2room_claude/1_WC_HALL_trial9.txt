Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects CELLIER and HALL
D2: Connects WC and HALL
D3: Connects WC and HALL
D4: Connects HALL and HALL (different sections)
D5: Connects HALL and HALL (different sections)
D6: Connects HALL and PORCHE
D7: Connects HALL and CUISINE
D8: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Connects CELLIER and GARAGE

Navigation Plan:
Starting from the WC, we need to reach the HALL. Based on the floor plan and the door connections, here's the step-by-step navigation plan:

1. ApproachDoor(3)
2. OpenDoor(3)
3. GoThrough(3)

This sequence will take the robot from the WC directly into the HALL, which is the destination.

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

This is the most efficient path from the WC to the HALL, using only the necessary door (D3) to reach the destination.
