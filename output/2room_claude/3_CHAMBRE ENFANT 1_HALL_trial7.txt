Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 to the HALL.

Room and Door Connections:
- D9: Connects CHAMBRE ENFANT 2 to HALL
- D10: Connects CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 to HALL

Based on these connections, here's the navigation plan to get from CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 to the HALL:

1. Start in CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
2. ApproachDoor(10)
3. OpenDoor(10)
4. GoThrough(10)

This sequence will take you directly from CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 to the HALL.

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CHAMBRE ENFANT 1",
  "end": "HALL",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 10}
  ]
}
```

This is the most efficient path from CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 to the HALL, using only the necessary door (D10) that directly connects these two spaces.
