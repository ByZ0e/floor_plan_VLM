Certainly! I'll analyze the floor plan, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan for you to move from the CELLIER to the GARAGE.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE
D2: Connects CELLIER to PORCHE
D3: Connects PORCHE to HALL
D4: Connects HALL to WC
D5: Connects HALL to LINGERIE
D6: Connects HALL to BUREAU
D7: Connects HALL to BAINS
D8: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE PARENTS
D9: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
D10: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
D11: Connects CELLIER to HALL

Step-by-step solution:
To navigate from CELLIER to GARAGE, we only need to use door D1. Here's the detailed plan:

1. Start in CELLIER
2. ApproachDoor(1)
3. OpenDoor(1)
4. GoThrough(1)
5. End in GARAGE

The final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CELLIER",
  "end": "GARAGE",
  "actions": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from CELLIER to GARAGE using only the necessary door (D1) without any unnecessary detours through other rooms or doors.
