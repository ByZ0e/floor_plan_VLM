Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the PORCHE to HALL 1.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER
D2: Connects PORCHE and CELLIER
D3: Connects PORCHE and HALL
D4: Connects HALL and WC
D5: Connects HALL and LINGERIE
D6: Connects HALL and BUREAU
D7: Connects HALL and BAINS
D8: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE PARENTS
D9: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
D10: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
D11: Connects CELLIER and HALL
D12: Connects HALL and PORCHE1 (upper floor)

Navigation Plan:
To go from PORCHE to HALL 1, we only need to use one door: D3.

Here's the step-by-step plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 3
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the PORCHE to HALL 1 using the most direct path available.
