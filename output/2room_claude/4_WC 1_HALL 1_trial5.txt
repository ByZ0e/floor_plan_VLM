Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from WC 1 to HALL 1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D21 connects WC 1 and HALL 1
2. D31 connects HALL 1 and CHAMBRE 4
3. D41 connects HALL 1 and CHAMBRE 4
4. D11 connects HALL 1 and CELLIER 1
5. D51 connects HALL 1 and CHAMBRE 3
6. D61 connects HALL 1 and PORCHE 1
7. D71 connects HALL 1 and CUISINE 1
8. D81 connects CUISINE 1 and TERRASSE COUVERTE 1
9. D91 connects CELLIER 1 and GARAGE 1

Navigation Plan:
To move from WC 1 to HALL 1, we only need to use one door: D21.

Here's the step-by-step plan:
1. ApproachDoor(21)
2. OpenDoor(21)
3. GoThrough(21)

Final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 21},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 21},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 21}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from WC 1 to HALL 1 using only the necessary door (D21) that connects these two areas.
