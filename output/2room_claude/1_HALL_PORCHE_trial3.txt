Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects CELLIER and HALL
D2: Connects HALL and BAINS
D3: Connects HALL and WC
D4: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 1
D5: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 2
D6: Connects HALL and PORCHE
D7: Connects HALL and CUISINE
D8: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Connects CELLIER and GARAGE

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
Starting from the HALL, we need to reach the PORCHE. Based on the floor plan and the door connections, we can see that there's a direct connection between HALL and PORCHE through door D6.

Here's the detailed navigation plan:

1. ApproachDoor(6)
2. OpenDoor(6)
3. GoThrough(6)

Now, let's present this plan in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the HALL to the PORCHE using only the necessary door (D6) that directly connects these two areas. The plan avoids any unnecessary rooms or doors, ensuring a straightforward path to the destination.
