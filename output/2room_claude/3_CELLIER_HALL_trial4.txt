Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE
2. D2: Connects CELLIER to PORCHE
3. D3: Connects PORCHE to HALL
4. D4: Connects HALL to WC
5. D5: Connects HALL to LINGERIE
6. D6: Connects HALL to BUREAU
7. D7: Connects HALL to BAINS
8. D8: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE PARENTS
9. D9: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
10. D10: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
11. D11: Connects CELLIER to HALL

Navigation Plan:
To go from CELLIER to HALL, we only need to use one door: D11.

Step-by-step solution:
1. ApproachDoor(11)
2. OpenDoor(11)
3. GoThrough(11)

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 11}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from the CELLIER to the HALL using only the necessary door (D11) that connects these two areas directly.
