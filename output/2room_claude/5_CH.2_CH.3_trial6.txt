Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the connections and provide a navigation plan as requested.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects Porche to SEJOUR
D2: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
D3: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
D4: Connects SEJOUR to DEGT
D5: Connects DEGT to CH.1
D6: Connects DEGT to CH.2
D7: Connects DEGT to BAINS
D8: Connects DEGT to WC
D9: Connects CH.2 to CH.3
D10: Connects CELLIER to Porche1
D11: Connects Porche1 to SEJOUR1
D21: Connects CELLIER1 to CUISINE1
D31: Connects SEJOUR1 to CUISINE1
D41: Connects SEJOUR1 to DEGT1
D51: Connects DEGT1 to CH.3
D61: Connects DEGT1 to CH.4
D71: Connects DEGT1 to BAINS1
D81: Connects DEGT1 to WC1

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CH.2
2. Use D9 to go directly from CH.2 to CH.3

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 9}
  ]
}
```

This is the most efficient path from CH.2 to CH.3, using only the necessary door (D9) that directly connects these two rooms.
