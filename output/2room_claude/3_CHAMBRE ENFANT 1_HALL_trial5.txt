Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 to HALL.

Room and Door Connections:
D10: Connects CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 and HALL
D9: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
D8: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE PARENTS
D7: Connects HALL and BAINS
D6: Connects HALL and BUREAU
D5: Connects HALL and LINGERIE
D4: Connects HALL and WC
D3: Connects HALL and PORCHE
D2: Connects PORCHE and CELLIER
D1: Connects CELLIER and GARAGE
D11: Connects CELLIER and HALL

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
2. Use D10 to enter the HALL

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 10}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 to HALL, using only the necessary door (D10) to reach the destination.
