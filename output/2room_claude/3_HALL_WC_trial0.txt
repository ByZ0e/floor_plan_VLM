Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms, doors, and their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the HALL to the WC.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects HALL to CELLIER
D2: Connects CELLIER to PORCHE
D3: Connects PORCHE to HALL
D4: Connects HALL to WC
D5: Connects HALL to LINGERIE
D6: Connects HALL to BUREAU
D7: Connects HALL to BAINS
D8: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE PARENTS
D9: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
D10: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
D11: Connects CELLIER to HALL

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in the HALL
2. Approach door D4
3. Open door D4
4. Go through door D4 to reach the WC

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient path from the HALL to the WC, using only the necessary door (D4) to reach the destination.
