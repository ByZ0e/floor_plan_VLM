Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to HALL 1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D10: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE to TERRASSE COUVERTE 1
2. D8: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE to CUISINE
3. D7: Connects CUISINE to HALL
4. D6: Connects HALL to PORCHE
5. D61: Connects HALL1 to PORCHE 1
4. D41: Connects HALL1 to CHAMBRE 4

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in TERRASSE COUVERTE
2. Use D8 to enter CUISINE
3. Use D7 to enter HALL
4. Use D6 to enter PORCHE
5. Use D61 to enter HALL1

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "TERRASSE COUVERTE",
  "end": "HALL 1",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D61"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides an efficient route from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to HALL 1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
