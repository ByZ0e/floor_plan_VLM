Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from CUISINE to SEJOUR.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects SEJOUR and PORCHE
2. D2 connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
3. D3 connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
4. D4 connects SEJOUR and DEGT
5. D5 connects CH.1 and DEGT
6. D6 connects CH.2 and DEGT
7. D7 connects BAINS and DEGT
8. D8 connects WC and DEGT

For the navigation from CUISINE to SEJOUR, we only need to use D3. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(3)
2. OpenDoor(3)
3. GoThrough(3)

The JSON format of the final path is:

```json
{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(3)",
    "OpenDoor(3)",
    "GoThrough(3)"
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates you from the CUISINE to the SEJOUR using the most direct route available based on the floor plan provided.
