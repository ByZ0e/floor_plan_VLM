Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the CUISINE to the SEJOUR.

Rooms and Doors Connections:
1. CUISINE connects to SEJOUR via D3
2. SEJOUR connects to CH.1 via D4
3. SEJOUR connects to CUISINE via D3
4. SEJOUR connects to PORCHE via D1
5. CELLIER connects to CUISINE via D2
6. CH.1 connects to DEGT via D5
7. CH.2 connects to DEGT via D6
8. DEGT connects to BAINS via D7
9. DEGT connects to WC via D8

Now, let's create the navigation plan from CUISINE to SEJOUR:

Step-by-step solution:
1. We start in the CUISINE
2. We need to go through D3 to reach the SEJOUR

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "doorNumber": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "doorNumber": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "doorNumber": 3
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the CUISINE to the SEJOUR using the most direct path available based on the floor plan provided.
