Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from DEGT to BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
D5: Connects CH.1 and DEGT
D6: Connects CH.2 and DEGT
D7: Connects DEGT and BAINS
D8: Connects CUISINE and BAINS

Navigation Plan:
Starting from DEGT, we only need to use one door to reach BAINS. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(7)
2. OpenDoor(7)
3. GoThrough(7)

This sequence will take you directly from DEGT to BAINS using the most efficient path.

Here's the plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "DEGT",
  "end": "BAINS",
  "steps": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7}
  ]
}
```

This plan ensures that you navigate from DEGT to BAINS using only the necessary door (D7) without going through any unnecessary rooms or doors.
