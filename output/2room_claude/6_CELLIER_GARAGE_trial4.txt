Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a detailed navigation plan for you to move from the CELLIER to the GARAGE.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE
D2: Connects CELLIER to PORCHE
D3: Connects PORCHE to HALL
D4: Connects HALL to WC
D5: Connects HALL to LINGERIE
D6: Connects HALL to BUREAU
D7: Connects HALL to BAINS
D8: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE PARENTS
D9: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
D10: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
D11: Connects CELLIER to HALL
D12: Connects HALL to HALL (different sections)

For your task of navigating from CELLIER to GARAGE, the most efficient path is:

1. ApproachDoor(1)
2. OpenDoor(1)
3. GoThrough(1)

This is the shortest and most direct route from the CELLIER to the GARAGE. Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CELLIER",
  "end": "GARAGE",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan ensures you take the most efficient route from the CELLIER directly to the GARAGE using only the necessary door (D1) without passing through any unnecessary rooms or doors.
