Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the PORCHE to the SEJOUR.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects PORCHE to SEJOUR
2. D2 connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
3. D3 connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
4. D4 connects SEJOUR to DEGT
5. D5 connects DEGT to CH.1
6. D6 connects DEGT to CH.2
7. D7 connects DEGT to BAINS
8. D8 connects DEGT to WC
9. D9 connects CH.2 to CH.4
10. D10 connects CELLIER to CUISINE

Step-by-step solution:
To navigate from PORCHE to SEJOUR, we only need to use one door:

1. ApproachDoor(1)
2. OpenDoor(1)
3. GoThrough(1)

This sequence will take the robot directly from PORCHE to SEJOUR.

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "PORCHE",
  "end": "SEJOUR",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from PORCHE to SEJOUR using only the necessary doors and actions.
