Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list the rooms and door connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from BAINS to HALL.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects CELLIER and HALL
2. D2 connects BAINS and HALL
3. D3 connects WC and HALL
4. D4 connects CHAMBRE 1 and HALL
5. D5 connects CHAMBRE 2 and HALL
6. D6 connects PORCHE and HALL
7. D7 connects CUISINE and HALL
8. D8 connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
9. D9 connects CELLIER and GARAGE

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in BAINS
2. ApproachDoor(D2)
3. OpenDoor(D2)
4. GoThrough(D2)

The navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "BAINS",
  "end": "HALL",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from BAINS to HALL using only the necessary door (D2) that connects these two areas.
