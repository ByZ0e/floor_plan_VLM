Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the connections and provide a navigation plan as requested.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D9: Connects CHAMBRE ENFANT 2 to HALL
D10: Connects CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 to HALL
D8: Connects CHAMBRE PARENTS to HALL
D7: Connects BAINS to HALL
D6: Connects BUREAU to HALL
D5: Connects LINGERIE to HALL
D4: Connects WC to HALL
D3: Connects HALL to PORCHE
D2: Connects PORCHE to CELLIER
D1: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE
D11: Connects CELLIER to HALL

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
2. Use D10 to enter the HALL

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 10}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 to the HALL, using only the necessary door (D10) to complete the task.
