Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the CELLIER to the CUISINE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CELLIER - connected to CUISINE via D2
2. CUISINE - connected to CELLIER via D2, to SEJOUR via D3
3. SEJOUR - connected to CUISINE via D3, to PORCHE via D1, to DEGT via D4
4. PORCHE - connected to SEJOUR via D1
5. DEGT - connected to SEJOUR via D4, to CH.1 via D5, to CH.2 via D6, to BAINS via D7
6. CH.1 - connected to DEGT via D5
7. CH.2 - connected to DEGT via D6
8. BAINS - connected to DEGT via D7, to WC via D8
9. WC - connected to BAINS via D8

Navigation Plan:
To go from CELLIER to CUISINE, we only need to use one door: D2.

Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(2)
2. OpenDoor(2)
3. GoThrough(2)

Now, I'll provide the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CELLIER",
  "end": "CUISINE",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient and direct route from the CELLIER to the CUISINE, using only the necessary door (D2) that connects these two rooms directly.
