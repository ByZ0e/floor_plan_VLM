Certainly! I'll analyze the floor plan, list the room and door connections, and then provide a detailed navigation plan from the CELLIER to the GARAGE.

Explicit Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE
D2: Connects CELLIER to PORCHE
D3: Connects PORCHE to HALL
D4: Connects HALL to WC
D5: Connects HALL to LINGERIE
D6: Connects HALL to BUREAU
D7: Connects HALL to BAINS
D8: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE PARENTS
D9: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
D10: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
D11: Connects CELLIER to HALL

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CELLIER
2. Use D1 to go directly to GARAGE

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from the CELLIER to the GARAGE using only the necessary doors. The robot will approach door D1, open it, and go through it to reach the GARAGE directly from the CELLIER.
