Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a detailed navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects CELLIER and HALL
D2: Connects BAINS and HALL
D3: Connects WC and HALL
D4: Connects CHAMBRE 1 and HALL
D5: Connects CHAMBRE 2 and HALL
D6: Connects HALL and PORCHE
D7: Connects HALL and CUISINE
D8: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Connects CELLIER and GARAGE

Now, for the navigation task from HALL to PORCHE, here's the step-by-step plan:

1. Start in the HALL
2. Locate door D6, which connects HALL to PORCHE
3. ApproachDoor(6)
4. OpenDoor(6)
5. GoThrough(6)

This is the most direct and efficient path from the HALL to the PORCHE. Here's the plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "HALL",
  "end": "PORCHE",
  "actions": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6}
  ]
}
```

This plan ensures that you use only the necessary doors and take the most direct route from the HALL to the PORCHE. The path avoids any unnecessary rooms or doors, and follows the given constraints of the robot's movement capabilities.
