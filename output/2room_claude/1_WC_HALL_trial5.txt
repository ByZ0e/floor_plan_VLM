Thank you for providing the floor plan and instructions. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the WC to the HALL.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects CELLIER and HALL
D2: Connects WC and HALL
D3: Connects WC and HALL
D4: Connects HALL and HALL (different sections)
D5: Connects HALL and HALL (different sections)
D6: Connects HALL and PORCHE
D7: Connects HALL and CUISINE
D8: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Connects CELLIER and GARAGE

Step-by-step solution:
Starting from the WC, we need to reach the HALL. The most direct path is through door D2 or D3, which both connect the WC to the HALL.

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2}
  ]
}
```

This plan is the most efficient route from the WC to the HALL, using only the necessary door (D2) to reach the destination. The plan avoids any unnecessary rooms or doors, providing a direct path to the goal.
