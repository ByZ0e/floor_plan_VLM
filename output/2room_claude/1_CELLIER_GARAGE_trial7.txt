Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the CELLIER to the GARAGE.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
D2: Connects HALL to BAINS
D3: Connects HALL to WC
D4: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 2
D6: Connects HALL to PORCHE
D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE
D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE

Navigation Plan:
To go from the CELLIER to the GARAGE, we only need to use one door: D9.

Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(9)
2. OpenDoor(9)
3. GoThrough(9)

The final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 9}
  ]
}
```

This is the most efficient path from the CELLIER to the GARAGE, using only the necessary door (D9) that directly connects these two rooms.
