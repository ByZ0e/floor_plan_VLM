Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the connections and provide a navigation plan as requested.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER
D2: Connects PORCHE to CELLIER
D3: Connects PORCHE to HALL
D4: Connects HALL to WC
D5: Connects HALL to LINGERIE
D6: Connects HALL to BUREAU
D7: Connects HALL to BAINS
D8: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE PARENTS
D9: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
D10: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
D11: Connects CELLIER to HALL
D12: Connects PORCHE1 to HALL1

For the navigation task from PORCHE to HALL 1, we need to use door D12. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(12)
2. OpenDoor(12)
3. GoThrough(12)

Now, here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "PORCHE",
  "end": "HALL 1",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 12},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 12},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 12}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from PORCHE to HALL 1 using only the necessary door (D12) that directly connects these two areas.
