Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll start by listing the relevant rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Relevant Room and Door Connections:
- CELLIER is connected to HALL via door D11
- HALL is connected to PORCHE via door D2
- PORCHE is connected to HALL via door D3

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
1. Start in CELLIER
2. Approach door D11
3. Open door D11
4. Go through door D11 to enter HALL

The navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D11"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D11"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D11"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the CELLIER to the HALL using only the necessary doors. The robot will start in the CELLIER, approach door D11, open it, and go through to enter the HALL, which is the final destination. No additional steps are needed as the HALL is directly accessible from the CELLIER through door D11.
