Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from PORCHE to SEJOUR.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects PORCHE to SEJOUR
2. D2: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
3. D3: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
4. D4: Connects SEJOUR to DEGT (Dégagement/Hallway)
5. D5: Connects DEGT to CH.1
6. D6: Connects DEGT to CH.2
7. D7: Connects DEGT to BAINS
8. D8: Connects DEGT to WC
9. D9: Connects CH.2 to CH.4 (separating the two sides of the floor plan)
10. D10: Connects CELLIER to CUISINE

Step-by-step solution:
To navigate from PORCHE to SEJOUR, we only need to use one door:

1. ApproachDoor(1)
2. OpenDoor(1)
3. GoThrough(1)

This sequence will take you directly from PORCHE to SEJOUR.

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "PORCHE",
  "end": "SEJOUR",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This is the most efficient path to reach SEJOUR from PORCHE, using only the necessary door (D1) that directly connects these two rooms.
