Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from the CELLIER to the GARAGE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE
2. D2: Connects CELLIER to PORCHE
3. D3: Connects PORCHE to HALL
4. D4: Connects HALL to WC
5. D5: Connects HALL to LINGERIE
6. D6: Connects HALL to BUREAU
7. D7: Connects HALL to BAINS
8. D8: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE PARENTS
9. D9: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
10. D10: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
11. D11: Connects CELLIER to HALL

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in CELLIER
2. ApproachDoor(D1)
3. OpenDoor(D1)
4. GoThrough(D1)

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CELLIER",
  "end": "GARAGE",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from the CELLIER to the GARAGE using only the necessary doors.
