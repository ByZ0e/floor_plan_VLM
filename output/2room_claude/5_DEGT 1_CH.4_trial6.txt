Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and their door connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from DEGT 1 to CH.4.

Room and Door Connections:
1. DEGT 1 - D51, D61
2. SEJOUR1 - D41, D31, D11
3. CUISINE 1 - D31, D21
4. CELLIER1 - D21
5. BAINS 1 - D71
6. CH.4 - D61
7. CH.3 - D51, D41
8. WC 1 - D81

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in DEGT 1
2. ApproachDoor(D61)
3. OpenDoor(D61)
4. GoThrough(D61)

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "DEGT 1",
  "end": "CH.4",
  "steps": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D61"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from DEGT 1 to CH.4 using only the necessary doors. The robot will approach door D61, open it, and go through to reach CH.4 directly from DEGT 1.
