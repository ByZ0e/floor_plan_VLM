Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the CELLIER to the GARAGE.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: CELLIER <-> GARAGE
D2: GARAGE <-> PORCHE
D3: PORCHE <-> HALL
D4: HALL <-> WC
D5: HALL <-> LINGERIE
D6: HALL <-> BUREAU
D7: HALL <-> BAINS
D8: HALL <-> CHAMBRE PARENTS
D9: HALL <-> CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
D10: HALL <-> CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
D11: CELLIER <-> HALL
D12: HALL <-> GARAGE

Navigation Plan:
To go from CELLIER to GARAGE, the most direct path is through door D1.

Here's the step-by-step navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the CELLIER to the GARAGE using the most direct path available.
