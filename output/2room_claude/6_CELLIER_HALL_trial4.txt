Thank you for providing the floor plan image and the navigation task. I'll start by listing the relevant rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Relevant Room and Door Connections:
- CELLIER is connected to HALL via Door D11
- HALL is connected to PORCHE via Door D2
- PORCHE is connected to HALL via Door D3

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
1. Start in CELLIER
2. Approach Door D11
3. Open Door D11
4. Go through Door D11 to enter HALL

This simple path takes you directly from CELLIER to HALL without any unnecessary steps or doors.

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D11"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates you from the CELLIER to the HALL using the most direct path available according to the floor plan provided.
