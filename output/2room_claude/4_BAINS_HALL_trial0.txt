Thank you for providing this detailed floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from BAINS to HALL.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects BAINS to HALL
2. D2: Connects WC to HALL
3. D3: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
4. D4: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
5. D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 2
6. D6: Connects HALL to PORCHE
7. D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE
8. D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
9. D9: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE
10. D10: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE to TERRASSE COUVERTE

Navigation Plan:
To go from BAINS to HALL, we only need to use one door:

1. ApproachDoor(1)
2. OpenDoor(1)
3. GoThrough(1)

This sequence will take you directly from BAINS to HALL.

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "BAINS",
  "end": "HALL",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This is the most efficient path from BAINS to HALL, using only the necessary door (D1) that directly connects these two rooms.
