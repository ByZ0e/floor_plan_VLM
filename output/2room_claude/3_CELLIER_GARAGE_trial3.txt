Certainly! Let's start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections based on the floor plan image:

Room and Door Connections:
1. CELLIER connects to HALL via D1
2. HALL connects to PORCHE via D3
3. PORCHE connects to GARAGE via D2

Now, let's create the navigation plan to go from CELLIER to GARAGE:

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CELLIER
2. Use D1 to go from CELLIER to HALL
3. Use D3 to go from HALL to PORCHE
4. Use D2 to go from PORCHE to GARAGE

Based on these connections and steps, here's the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides an efficient and correct path from CELLIER to GARAGE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours. The plan takes into account that doors close after each GoThrough action, so each door needs to be approached and opened before going through.
