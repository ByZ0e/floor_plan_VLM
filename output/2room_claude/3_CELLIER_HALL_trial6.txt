Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the room and door connections, then provide the navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE
D2: Connects CELLIER to PORCHE
D3: Connects PORCHE to HALL
D4: Connects HALL to WC
D5: Connects HALL to LINGERIE
D6: Connects HALL to BUREAU
D7: Connects HALL to BAINS
D8: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE PARENTS
D9: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
D10: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
D11: Connects CELLIER to HALL

Navigation Plan:
To navigate from CELLIER to HALL, the most efficient path is to use door D11.

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CELLIER
2. ApproachDoor(11)
3. OpenDoor(11)
4. GoThrough(11)
5. Arrive in HALL

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CELLIER",
  "end": "HALL",
  "actions": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 11}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from CELLIER to HALL using only the necessary door.
