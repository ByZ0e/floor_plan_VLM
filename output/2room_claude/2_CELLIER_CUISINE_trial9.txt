Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the CELLIER to the CUISINE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D2 connects CELLIER and CUISINE
2. D1 connects SEJOUR and Porche
3. D3 connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
4. D4 connects SEJOUR and DEGT
5. D5 connects CH.1 and DEGT
6. D6 connects CH.2 and DEGT
7. D7 connects BAINS and DEGT
8. D8 connects WC and DEGT

Navigation Plan:
To go from CELLIER to CUISINE, we only need to use one door: D2.

Here's the step-by-step navigation plan:

1. ApproachDoor(2)
2. OpenDoor(2)
3. GoThrough(2)

Final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CELLIER",
  "end": "CUISINE",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2}
  ]
}
```

This is the most efficient path from CELLIER to CUISINE, using only the necessary door (D2) that directly connects these two rooms.
