Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll start by listing the relevant rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Relevant Room and Door Connections:
- BAINS is connected to HALL via door D2
- HALL is connected to CHAMBRE 1 via door D4
- HALL is connected to CHAMBRE 2 via door D5
- HALL is connected to CUISINE via door D6

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in BAINS
2. Use door D2 to go from BAINS to HALL

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D2"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D2"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D2"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from BAINS to HALL using the most direct route available. The robot will approach door D2, open it, and go through to reach the HALL, which is the final destination. No unnecessary doors or rooms are included in this plan.
