Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms and doors, create a list of connections, and then provide a navigation plan from CH.2 to CH.3.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects Porche to SEJOUR
2. D2: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
3. D3: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
4. D4: Connects SEJOUR to DEGT
5. D5: Connects DEGT to CH.1
6. D6: Connects DEGT to CH.2
7. D7: Connects DEGT to BAINS
8. D8: Connects DEGT to WC
9. D9: Connects CH.2 to CH.3
10. D10: Connects CELLIER to Porche1
11. D11: Connects Porche1 to SEJOUR1
12. D21: Connects SEJOUR1 to CUISINE1
13. D31: Connects SEJOUR1 to CUISINE1
14. D41: Connects SEJOUR1 to DEGT1
15. D51: Connects DEGT1 to CH.3
16. D61: Connects DEGT1 to CH.4
17. D71: Connects DEGT1 to BAINS1
18. D81: Connects DEGT1 to WC1

Step-by-step navigation plan from CH.2 to CH.3:
1. ApproachDoor(D9)
2. OpenDoor(D9)
3. GoThrough(D9)

The most efficient path from CH.2 to CH.3 is directly through door D9, which connects these two rooms.

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from CH.2 to CH.3 using only the necessary doors and actions.
