Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from PORCHE to SEJOUR.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects PORCHE and SEJOUR
2. D2 connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
3. D3 connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
4. D4 connects SEJOUR and DEGT
5. D5 connects DEGT and CH.1
6. D6 connects DEGT and CH.2
7. D7 connects DEGT and BAINS
8. D8 connects DEGT and WC
9. D9 connects CH.2 and CH.4
10. D10 connects CELLIER and CUISINE

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
1. Start in PORCHE
2. ApproachDoor(D1)
3. OpenDoor(D1)
4. GoThrough(D1)

This plan will take you directly from PORCHE to SEJOUR using the most efficient route.

JSON format of the final path:
```json
{
  "start": "PORCHE",
  "end": "SEJOUR",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan uses only the necessary door (D1) to move from PORCHE to SEJOUR in the most direct and efficient manner.
