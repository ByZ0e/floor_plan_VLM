Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Explicit Room and Door Connections:
D10: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE to TERRASSE COUVERTE 1
D8: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE to CUISINE
D81: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE 1 to CUISINE 1
D7: Connects CUISINE to HALL
D71: Connects CUISINE 1 to HALL 1
D6: Connects HALL to PORCHE
D61: Connects HALL 1 to PORCHE 1

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in TERRASSE COUVERTE
2. Use D8 to enter CUISINE
3. Use D7 to enter HALL
4. Use D6 to enter PORCHE
5. Use D61 to enter HALL 1 (destination)

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D61"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides an efficient route from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to HALL 1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
