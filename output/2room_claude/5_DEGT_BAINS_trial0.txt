Thank you for providing the floor plan image and the navigation task. Let me first list out the rooms and doors with their connections based on the image:

Room and Door Connections:
1. DEGT connects to SEJOUR via D4
2. DEGT connects to CH.1 via D5
3. DEGT connects to CH.2 via D6
4. SEJOUR connects to CUISINE via D3
5. CUISINE connects to CELLIER via D2
6. CELLIER connects to Porche via D1
7. SEJOUR connects to WC via D8
8. WC connects to BAINS via D7
9. CH.2 connects to CH.3 via D9
10. CELLIER connects to CELLIER1 via D10
11. Porche1 connects to SEJOUR1 via D11
12. SEJOUR1 connects to CUISINE1 via D31
13. SEJOUR1 connects to WC1 via D81
14. WC1 connects to BAINS1 via D71
15. SEJOUR1 connects to CH.3 via D41
16. CH.3 connects to CH.4 via D61
17. DEGT1 connects to CH.3 via D51

Now, let's create the navigation plan to go from DEGT to BAINS:

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in DEGT
2. Go to SEJOUR through D4
3. Go to WC through D8
4. Go to BAINS through D7

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from DEGT to BAINS using only the necessary doors and rooms.
