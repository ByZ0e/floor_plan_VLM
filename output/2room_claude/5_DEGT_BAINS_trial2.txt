Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms and doors, create a list of connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from DEGT to BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects Porche and SEJOUR
2. D2: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
3. D3: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
4. D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
5. D5: Connects DEGT and CH.1
6. D6: Connects DEGT and CH.2
7. D7: Connects DEGT and BAINS
8. D8: Connects DEGT and WC
9. D9: Connects CH.2 and CH.4
10. D10: Connects CELLIER and CUISINE
11. D11: Connects Porche1 and SEJOUR1
12. D21: Connects SEJOUR1 and CUISINE1
13. D31: Connects SEJOUR1 and CUISINE1
14. D41: Connects SEJOUR1 and DEGT1
15. D51: Connects DEGT1 and CH.3
16. D61: Connects DEGT1 and CH.4
17. D71: Connects DEGT1 and BAINS1
18. D81: Connects DEGT1 and WC1

Now, let's create the navigation plan from DEGT to BAINS:

Step-by-step solution:
1. We start in DEGT
2. Door D7 connects DEGT directly to BAINS
3. We need to approach, open, and go through D7

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D7"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D7"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D7"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient path from DEGT to BAINS using only the necessary doors.
