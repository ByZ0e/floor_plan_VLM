Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to the CUISINE.

Room and Door Connections:

D8: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE and CUISINE
D7: Connects HALL and CUISINE
D6: Connects HALL and PORCHE
D5: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 2
D4: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 1
D3: Connects HALL and WC
D2: Connects HALL and BAINS
D1: Connects HALL and CELLIER
D9: Connects CELLIER and GARAGE

Step-by-step navigation plan:

1. Start in TERRASSE COUVERTE
2. ApproachDoor(D8)
3. OpenDoor(D8)
4. GoThrough(D8)

This plan will take you directly from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to the CUISINE using the most efficient path.

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "TERRASSE COUVERTE",
  "end": "CUISINE",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to the CUISINE, using only the necessary door (D8) to complete the navigation task.
