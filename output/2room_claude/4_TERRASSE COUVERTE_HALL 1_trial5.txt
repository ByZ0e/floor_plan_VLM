Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to HALL 1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D10: TERRASSE COUVERTE <-> TERRASSE COUVERTE
2. D8/D81: TERRASSE COUVERTE <-> CUISINE/CUISINE1
3. D7/D71: CUISINE/CUISINE1 <-> HALL/HALL1
4. D6/D61: HALL <-> PORCHE/PORCHE1
5. D5/D51: HALL <-> CHAMBRE 2/CHAMBRE 3
6. D4/D41: HALL <-> CHAMBRE 1/CHAMBRE 4
3. D3/D31: HALL <-> WC
2. D2/D21: HALL <-> BAINS
1. D1/D11: HALL <-> CELLIER/CELLIER1
9. D9/D91: CELLIER/CELLIER1 <-> GARAGE/GARAGE1

Now, I'll provide the step-by-step navigation plan:

1. ApproachDoor(D10)
2. OpenDoor(D10)
3. GoThrough(D10)
4. ApproachDoor(D8)
5. OpenDoor(D8)
6. GoThrough(D8)
7. ApproachDoor(D7)
8. OpenDoor(D7)
9. GoThrough(D7)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"}
  ]
}
```

This path takes you from the TERRASSE COUVERTE through the CUISINE and into HALL 1, which is the most direct and efficient route based on the floor plan provided.
