Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the image, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the CELLIER to the HALL.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER
D2: Connects GARAGE and PORCHE
D3: Connects PORCHE and HALL
D4: Connects HALL and WC
D5: Connects HALL and LINGERIE
D6: Connects HALL and BUREAU
D7: Connects HALL and BAINS
D8: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE PARENTS
D9: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
D10: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
D11: Connects CELLIER and HALL
D12: Connects GARAGE and HALL (upper level)

Based on these connections, here's the step-by-step navigation plan from CELLIER to HALL:

1. ApproachDoor(11)
2. OpenDoor(11)
3. GoThrough(11)

This is the most direct and efficient path from the CELLIER to the HALL. Now, I'll provide the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CELLIER",
  "end": "HALL",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 11}
  ]
}
```

This plan ensures that you navigate from the CELLIER to the HALL using the most direct route available, utilizing only the necessary door (D11) that connects these two areas directly.
