Thank you for providing the floor plan. Let me analyze the rooms and doors, and then provide you with a navigation plan.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects CELLIER and SEJOUR
D2: Connects CELLIER and CUISINE
D3: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
D5: Connects CH.1 and DEGT
D6: Connects DEGT and CH.2
D7: Connects DEGT and BAINS
D8: Connects DEGT and WC

Now, let's create a navigation plan to move from the CELLIER to the CUISINE:

Step-by-step solution:
1. You are starting in the CELLIER.
2. The most direct route to the CUISINE is through door D2.
3. You need to approach D2, open it, and go through it to reach the CUISINE.

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "doorNumber": 2
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "doorNumber": 2
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "doorNumber": 2
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the CELLIER to the CUISINE, using only the necessary door (D2) to complete the task.
