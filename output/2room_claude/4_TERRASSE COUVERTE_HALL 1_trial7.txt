Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to HALL 1.

Room and Door Connections:
- D10: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE to TERRASSE COUVERTE 1
- D81: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE 1 to CUISINE 1
- D71: Connects CUISINE 1 to HALL 1
- D61: Connects HALL 1 to PORCHE 1
- D51: Connects HALL 1 to CHAMBRE 3
- D41: Connects HALL 1 to CHAMBRE 4
- D21: Connects HALL 1 to WC 1
- D11: Connects HALL 1 to CELLIER 1
- D91: Connects CELLIER 1 to GARAGE 1

Navigation Plan:
To get from TERRASSE COUVERTE to HALL 1, we need to go through the following doors: D10, D81, and D71.

Here's the step-by-step navigation plan:

1. ApproachDoor(10)
2. OpenDoor(10)
3. GoThrough(10)
4. ApproachDoor(81)
5. OpenDoor(81)
6. GoThrough(81)
7. ApproachDoor(71)
8. OpenDoor(71)
9. GoThrough(71)

Now, I'll provide the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 10},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 81},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 81},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 81},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 71},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 71},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 71}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to HALL 1 using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
