Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from WC 1 to HALL 1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D21 connects WC 1 to HALL 1
2. D31 connects CHAMBRE 4 to HALL 1
3. D41 connects HALL 1 to HALL 1 (different sections)
4. D51 connects CHAMBRE 3 to HALL 1
5. D61 connects HALL 1 to PORCHE 1
6. D71 connects CUISINE 1 to HALL 1
7. D81 connects CUISINE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE 1
8. D91 connects CELLIER 1 to GARAGE 1

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in WC 1
2. ApproachDoor(D21)
3. OpenDoor(D21)
4. GoThrough(D21)

Final navigation plan in JSON format:
```json
{
  "start": "WC 1",
  "end": "HALL 1",
  "steps": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D21"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D21"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D21"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from WC 1 to HALL 1, using only the necessary door (D21) to complete the navigation task.
