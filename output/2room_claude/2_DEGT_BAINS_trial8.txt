Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from DEGT to BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
D5: Connects CH.1 and DEGT
D6: Connects CH.2 and DEGT
D7: Connects DEGT and BAINS
D8: Connects CUISINE and WC

Navigation Plan:

To navigate from DEGT to BAINS, we only need to use one door: D7. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(7)
2. OpenDoor(7)
3. GoThrough(7)

This sequence will take the robot from DEGT directly to BAINS using the most efficient path.

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7}
  ]
}
```

This plan ensures that the robot takes the most direct route from DEGT to BAINS without unnecessary detours or actions.
