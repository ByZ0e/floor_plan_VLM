Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects CELLIER and HALL
D2: Connects WC and HALL
D3: Connects WC and HALL
D4: Connects HALL and HALL (different sections)
D5: Connects HALL and HALL (different sections)
D6: Connects HALL and PORCHE
D7: Connects HALL and CUISINE
D8: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Connects CELLIER and GARAGE

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in WC
2. Use D3 to enter HALL

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient path from the WC to the HALL using only the necessary doors. The robot will approach D3, open it, and go through to reach the HALL, completing the navigation task.
