Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the room and door connections, then provide a navigation plan from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to the CUISINE.

Room and Door Connections:
D8: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE to CUISINE
D7: Connects CUISINE to HALL
D6: Connects HALL to PORCHE
D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 2
D4: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
D3: Connects HALL to WC
D2: Connects WC to BAINS
D1: Connects HALL to CELLIER
D9: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in TERRASSE COUVERTE
2. Approach door D8
3. Open door D8
4. Go through door D8 to enter CUISINE

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to the CUISINE, using only the necessary door (D8) to reach the destination.
