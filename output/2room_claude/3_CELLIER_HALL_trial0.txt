Certainly! I'll analyze the floor plan, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from CELLIER to HALL.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER
D2: Connects CELLIER and PORCHE
D3: Connects PORCHE and HALL
D4: Connects HALL and WC
D5: Connects HALL and LINGERIE
D6: Connects HALL and BUREAU
D7: Connects HALL and BAINS
D8: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE PARENTS
D9: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
D10: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
D11: Connects CELLIER and HALL

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CELLIER
2. Use D11 to go directly from CELLIER to HALL

Final Navigation Plan in JSON format:
```json
{
  "start": "CELLIER",
  "end": "HALL",
  "steps": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 11}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from CELLIER to HALL using only the necessary door (D11) that directly connects these two areas. The robot will approach door 11, open it, and go through to reach the HALL, completing the navigation task in the most direct manner possible.
