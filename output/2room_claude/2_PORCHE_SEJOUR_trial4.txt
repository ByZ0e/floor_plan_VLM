Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the PORCHE to the SEJOUR.

Room and Door Connections:
1. PORCHE connects to SEJOUR through D1
2. SEJOUR connects to CUISINE through D3
3. SEJOUR connects to DEGT through D4
4. CH.1 connects to DEGT through D5
5. CH.2 connects to DEGT through D6
6. DEGT connects to BAINS through D7
7. DEGT connects to WC through D8
8. CELLIER connects to CUISINE through D2

Now, let's create the navigation plan:

Step 1: We start in the PORCHE.
Step 2: We need to go through D1 to enter the SEJOUR.

Here's the action plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the PORCHE to the SEJOUR using the necessary doors. No additional steps are required as the SEJOUR is directly accessible from the PORCHE through D1.
