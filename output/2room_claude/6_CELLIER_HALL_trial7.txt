Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the CELLIER to the HALL.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: GARAGE <-> CELLIER
2. D2: GARAGE <-> PORCHE
3. D3: PORCHE <-> HALL
4. D4: HALL <-> WC
5. D5: HALL <-> LINGERIE
6. D6: HALL <-> BUREAU
7. D7: HALL <-> BAINS
8. D8: HALL <-> CHAMBRE PARENTS
9. D9: HALL <-> CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
10. D10: HALL <-> CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
11. D11: CELLIER <-> HALL
12. D12: GARAGE <-> HALL

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CELLIER
2. Use D11 to go from CELLIER to HALL

Final Navigation Plan in JSON format:
```json
{
  "start": "CELLIER",
  "end": "HALL",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 11}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from the CELLIER to the HALL using only the necessary doors. The robot will approach door D11, open it, and go through to reach the HALL, which is the destination.
