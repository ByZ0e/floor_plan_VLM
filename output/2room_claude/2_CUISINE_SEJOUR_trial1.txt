Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan from CUISINE to SEJOUR.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

Rooms:
1. CUISINE
2. SEJOUR
3. CELLIER
4. Porche
5. CH.1
6. CH.2
7. DEGT (Dégagement, likely a hallway or landing)
8. BAINS
9. WC

Doors and their connections:
D1: Connects SEJOUR and Porche
D2: Connects CUISINE and CELLIER
D3: Connects CUISINE and SEJOUR
D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
D5: Connects CH.1 and DEGT
D6: Connects CH.2 and DEGT
D7: Connects BAINS and DEGT
D8: Connects WC and DEGT

Now, let's create the navigation plan from CUISINE to SEJOUR:

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CUISINE
2. Use D3 to go from CUISINE to SEJOUR

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from CUISINE to SEJOUR using only the necessary door (D3) that connects these two rooms directly.
