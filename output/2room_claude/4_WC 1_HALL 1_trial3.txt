Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a detailed navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
D11: Connects BAINS 1 to HALL 1
D21: Connects WC 1 to HALL 1
D31: Connects HALL 1 to CHAMBRE 4
D41: Connects HALL 1 to HALL 1 (different sections)
D51: Connects HALL 1 to CHAMBRE 3
D61: Connects HALL 1 to PORCHE 1
D71: Connects HALL 1 to CUISINE 1
D81: Connects CUISINE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE 1
D91: Connects CELLIER 1 to GARAGE 1

Navigation Plan:
To go from WC 1 to HALL 1, we only need to use one door: D21.

Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(21)
2. OpenDoor(21)
3. GoThrough(21)

Now, let's present this in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 21},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 21},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 21}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from WC 1 to HALL 1 using only the necessary door (D21) without any unnecessary steps or rooms involved.
