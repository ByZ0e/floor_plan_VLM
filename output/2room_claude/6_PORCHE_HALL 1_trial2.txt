Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the connections and provide a navigation plan as requested.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER
D2: Connects PORCHE to CELLIER
D3: Connects PORCHE to HALL
D4: Connects HALL to WC
D5: Connects HALL to LINGERIE
D6: Connects HALL to BUREAU
D7: Connects HALL to BAINS
D8: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE PARENTS
D9: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
D10: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
D11: Connects CELLIER to HALL
D12: Connects PORCHE1 to HALL1 (upper floor)

For the navigation task from PORCHE to HALL 1, we only need to use one door:

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in PORCHE
2. ApproachDoor(D3)
3. OpenDoor(D3)
4. GoThrough(D3)

This sequence will take you from PORCHE directly to HALL, which is labeled as HALL 1 in some parts of the floor plan.

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"}
  ]
}
```

This is the most efficient path to reach HALL 1 from PORCHE, using only the necessary door (D3) that directly connects these two areas.
