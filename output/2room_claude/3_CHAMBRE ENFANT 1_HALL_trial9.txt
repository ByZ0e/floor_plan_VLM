Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan from CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 to the HALL.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D9: Connects CHAMBRE ENFANT 2 to HALL
D10: Connects CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 to HALL
D6: Connects BUREAU to HALL
D5: Connects LINGERIE to HALL
D4: Connects WC to HALL
D3: Connects HALL to PORCHE
D2: Connects PORCHE to CELLIER
D1: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE
D7: Connects BAINS to HALL
D8: Connects CHAMBRE PARENTS to HALL
D11: Connects CELLIER to HALL

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
2. Use D10 to enter the HALL

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CHAMBRE ENFANT 1",
  "end": "HALL",
  "steps": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 10
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 10
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 10
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient path from CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 to the HALL, using only the necessary door (D10) to complete the navigation task.
