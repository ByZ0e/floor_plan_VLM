Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the CELLIER to the HALL.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CELLIER connects to HALL via D1 and D11
2. HALL connects to PORCHE via D2 and D3
3. HALL connects to WC via D4
4. HALL connects to LINGERIE via D5
5. HALL connects to BUREAU via D6
6. HALL connects to BAINS via D7
7. HALL connects to CHAMBRE PARENTS via D8
8. HALL connects to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2 via D9 and D10

For the navigation task from CELLIER to HALL, we only need to use one door. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(11)
2. OpenDoor(11)
3. GoThrough(11)

Now, let me provide this plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CELLIER",
  "end": "HALL",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 11}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the CELLIER to the HALL using the most direct route available based on the floor plan provided.
