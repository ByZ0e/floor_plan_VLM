Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll analyze the layout, list the relevant room and door connections, and then provide a detailed navigation plan to get from PORCHE 1 to CELLIER 1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D21 connects PORCHE1 to CELLIER 1
2. D31 connects PORCHE1 to HALL1
3. D13 connects GARAGE1 to CELLIER 1
4. D111 connects CELLIER 1 to HALL1

For this specific navigation task, we only need to use one door:

Navigation Plan:
1. ApproachDoor(21)
2. OpenDoor(21)
3. GoThrough(21)

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "PORCHE1",
  "end": "CELLIER 1",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 21},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 21},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 21}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from PORCHE1 to CELLIER 1 using only the necessary door (D21) that connects these two rooms directly. No additional rooms or doors need to be traversed for this particular navigation task.
