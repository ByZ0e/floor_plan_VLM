Certainly! I'll provide a detailed analysis of the floor plan, list the room and door connections, and then create an efficient navigation plan for you to move from the CELLIER to the HALL.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER
D2: Connects CELLIER and PORCHE
D3: Connects PORCHE and HALL
D4: Connects HALL and WC
D5: Connects HALL and LINGERIE
D6: Connects HALL and BUREAU
D7: Connects HALL and BAINS
D8: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE PARENTS
D9: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
D10: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
D11: Connects CELLIER and HALL

Step-by-step solution:
1. You are starting in the CELLIER.
2. The most direct path to the HALL is through door D11.
3. Approach door D11.
4. Open door D11.
5. Go through door D11 to enter the HALL.

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 11}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the CELLIER to the HALL, using only the necessary door (D11) and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors. The plan ensures that you, as a robot, can navigate through the building using only the available doors to reach your destination.
