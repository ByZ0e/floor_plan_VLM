Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the connections and provide a navigation plan as requested.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D31: Connects SEJOUR1 and CUISINE1
D41: Connects SEJOUR1 and DEGT1
D51: Connects DEGT1 and CH.3
D61: Connects DEGT1 and CH.4
D71: Connects DEGT1 and BAINS1

Now, let's create the navigation plan from DEGT1 to CH.4:

Step-by-step solution:
1. We start in DEGT1.
2. CH.4 is directly connected to DEGT1 via door D61.
3. We need to approach, open, and go through door D61 to reach CH.4.

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D61"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D61"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient path from DEGT1 to CH.4, using only the necessary door (D61) that connects these two rooms.
