Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the connections and provide you with a navigation plan as requested. Let's start by listing the relevant rooms and doors with their connections:

Room and Door Connections:
- PORCHE1 <-> D21 <-> CELLIER 1
- CELLIER 1 <-> D111 <-> HALL 1

Now, let's create the navigation plan to go from PORCHE to HALL 1:

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in PORCHE1
2. Use D21 to enter CELLIER 1
3. Use D111 to enter HALL 1

Based on these connections and steps, here's the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 21},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 21},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 21},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 111},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 111},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 111}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the PORCHE to HALL 1 using only the necessary doors. Remember that each door will close after you go through it, so the opening actions are necessary for each door.
