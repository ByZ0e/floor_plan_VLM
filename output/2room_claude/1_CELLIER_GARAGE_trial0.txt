Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the connections and provide a navigation plan for you to move from the CELLIER to the GARAGE. Let's start by listing the relevant rooms and doors with their connections:

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
- D9: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE

Now, let's create the step-by-step navigation plan:

1. Starting in the CELLIER
2. Approach door D9
3. Open door D9
4. Go through door D9 to enter the GARAGE

Based on this analysis, here's the efficient navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 9}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct route from the CELLIER to the GARAGE using only the necessary door (D9). There's no need to go through any other rooms or use any other doors, as there is a direct connection between these two spaces.
