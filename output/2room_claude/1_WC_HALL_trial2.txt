Certainly! I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections based on the floor plan image, and then provide a step-by-step navigation plan from the WC to the HALL.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects CELLIER and HALL
2. D2: Connects WC and HALL
3. D3: Connects WC and HALL (another entrance)
4. D4: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 1
5. D5: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 2
6. D6: Connects HALL and PORCHE
7. D7: Connects HALL and CUISINE
8. D8: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
9. D9: Connects CELLIER and GARAGE

Step-by-step solution:
Starting from the WC, we need to reach the HALL. The most direct path is to use door D2 or D3, which both connect the WC to the HALL. We'll use D2 for this navigation plan.

Here's the JSON format for the navigation plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2}
  ]
}
```

This plan is efficient and uses only the necessary doors to navigate from the WC to the HALL. The robot will approach door D2, open it, and go through it to reach the HALL, which is the final destination.
