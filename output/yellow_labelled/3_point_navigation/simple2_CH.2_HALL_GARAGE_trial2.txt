### Room and Door Descriptions

**Rooms:**
- CH.1
- CH.2
- Bains
- Hall
- Cuisine
- Garage

**Doors:**
- D1: Connects Bains and Hall
- D2: Connects CH.1 and Hall
- D3: Connects CH.2 and Hall
- D4: Connects Hall and Garage
- D5: Connects Cuisine and Hall

### Navigation Plan

Starting in CH.2, the goal is to navigate to the Hall and then to the Garage. The necessary doors to traverse are D3 and D4.

```json
[
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
]
```

### Explanation
1. **ApproachDoor(D3)**: Move in front of door D3 from CH.2.
2. **OpenDoor(D3)**: Open door D3.
3. **GoThrough(D3)**: Move through door D3 to enter the Hall.
4. **ApproachDoor(D4)**: Move in front of door D4 from the Hall.
5. **OpenDoor(D4)**: Open door D4.
6. **GoThrough(D4)**: Move through door D4 to enter the Garage.

This sequence ensures that the robot navigates efficiently from CH.2 to the Hall and then to the Garage, using only the necessary doors.
