Here is the detailed list of rooms and doors with their connections:

**Rooms:**
1. CH.1
2. CH.2
3. Bains
4. Hall
5. Cuisine
6. Garage

**Doors:**
1. D1: Connects Bains and Hall
2. D2: Connects CH.1 and Hall
3. D3: Connects CH.2 and Hall
4. D4: Connects Hall and Garage
5. D5: Connects Cuisine and Hall

**Navigation Plan:**

Starting in CH.1, the goal is to reach the Garage. The sequence of actions is as follows:

1. ApproachDoor(D2): Move in front of door D2.
2. OpenDoor(D2): Open door D2.
3. GoThrough(D2): Move through open door D2 to the Hall.
4. ApproachDoor(D4): Move in front of door D4.
5. OpenDoor(D4): Open door D4.
6. GoThrough(D4): Move through open door D4 to the Garage.

Here is the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
  ]
}
```

This plan ensures that you move efficiently from CH.1 to the Garage, using only the necessary doors.
