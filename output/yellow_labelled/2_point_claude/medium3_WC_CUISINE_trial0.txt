Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors, and then provide you with a navigation plan from the WC to the CUISINE.

Room and Door Connections:
- WC: Connected to HALL via D4
- HALL: Connected to WC (D4), DOUCHE (D2), CHAMBRE 1 (D5), CUISINE (D6), and CELLIER (D3)
- DOUCHE: Connected to HALL via D2
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D5
- CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D6 and D7
- CELLIER: Connected to HALL via D3
- GARAGES: Connected to CELLIER via D1

Navigation Plan:
To go from the WC to the CUISINE, we need to use two doors: D4 and D6. Here's the detailed plan:

{
  "plan": [
    "ApproachDoor(D4)",
    "OpenDoor(D4)",
    "GoThrough(D4)",
    "ApproachDoor(D6)",
    "OpenDoor(D6)",
    "GoThrough(D6)"
  ]
}

This plan will efficiently take you from the WC to the CUISINE using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
