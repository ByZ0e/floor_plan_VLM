First, I'll list out the rooms and doors with their connections based on the floor plan:

Rooms and their connections:
- CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE via D3, to GARAGES via D1
- CUISINE: Connected to CELLIER via D3, to HALL via D6
- GARAGES: Connected to CELLIER via D1
- WC: Connected to HALL via D4
- DOUCHE: Connected to HALL via D2
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D5
- HALL: Central area connecting multiple rooms

Doors:
D1: Connects CELLIER and GARAGES
D2: Connects DOUCHE and HALL
D3: Connects CELLIER and CUISINE
D4: Connects WC and HALL
D5: Connects CHAMBRE 1 and HALL
D6: Connects CUISINE and HALL
D7: Connects CUISINE and HALL (lower part)

Now, for the navigation plan from CELLIER to HALL:

The most efficient path would be:
CELLIER -> D3 -> CUISINE -> D6 -> HALL

Here's the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D3"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D3"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D3"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D6"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D6"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D6"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates you from the CELLIER to the HALL using the minimum number of necessary doors and rooms.
