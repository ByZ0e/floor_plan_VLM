Thank you for providing the floor plan. Let me first list out the rooms and doors with their connections for reference:

Rooms and their connections:
- GARAGE: Connected to CUISINE via D4
- CUISINE: Connected to GARAGE via D4, to HALL via D5
- HALL: Central area connecting multiple rooms
- BAINS: Connected to HALL via D1
- CH.1: Connected to HALL via D2
- CH.2: Connected to HALL via D3

Doors and their connections:
- D1: Connects BAINS to HALL
- D2: Connects CH.1 to HALL
- D3: Connects CH.2 to HALL
- D4: Connects GARAGE to CUISINE
- D5: Connects CUISINE to HALL

Now, for the navigation plan from GARAGE to CH.2:

1. Start in GARAGE
2. ApproachDoor(D4)
3. OpenDoor(D4)
4. GoThrough(D4)
5. ApproachDoor(D5)
6. OpenDoor(D5)
7. GoThrough(D5)
8. ApproachDoor(D3)
9. OpenDoor(D3)
10. GoThrough(D3)

This plan takes you from the GARAGE through the CUISINE and HALL to reach CH.2 using the most direct route available.

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(D4)",
    "OpenDoor(D4)",
    "GoThrough(D4)",
    "ApproachDoor(D5)",
    "OpenDoor(D5)",
    "GoThrough(D5)",
    "ApproachDoor(D3)",
    "OpenDoor(D3)",
    "GoThrough(D3)"
  ]
}
```

This path ensures you navigate efficiently from the GARAGE to CH.2 using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
