Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze it and provide you with a detailed navigation plan as requested. First, let me list out the rooms and doors with their connections:

Rooms and their connections:
1. CH. PARENTS - connected to CUISINE via D3
2. DOUCHE - connected to CUISINE via D4
3. CUISINE (large central area) - connected to CH. PARENTS via D3, DOUCHE via D4, CELLIER via D2, and TERRASSE COUVERTE via D1
4. CELLIER - connected to CUISINE via D2
5. TERRASSE COUVERTE - connected to CUISINE via D1

Doors:
D1: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
D2: Connects CUISINE to CELLIER
D3: Connects CUISINE to CH. PARENTS
D4: Connects CUISINE to DOUCHE

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan to go from CH. PARENTS to TERRASSE COUVERTE:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently guide you from CH. PARENTS to TERRASSE COUVERTE using only the necessary doors. You'll start in CH. PARENTS, go through D3 to enter the main CUISINE area, and then use D1 to reach the TERRASSE COUVERTE. This is the most direct and efficient path based on the floor plan provided.
