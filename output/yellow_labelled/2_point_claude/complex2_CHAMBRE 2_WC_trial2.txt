Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first describe the rooms and doors, then provide the navigation plan.

Room and Door Descriptions:
- CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL via D2
- HALL: Central area connecting multiple rooms
- WC: Connected to HALL via D4
- CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D7
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D6
- BAINS: Connected to HALL via D3
- PORCHE: Connected to HALL via D5
- CELLIER: Connected to GARAGE via D9 and to HALL via D1
- GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER via D9
- TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE via D8

Navigation Plan:
To go from CHAMBRE 2 to WC, the most efficient path is:

{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(D2)",
    "OpenDoor(D2)",
    "GoThrough(D2)",
    "ApproachDoor(D4)",
    "OpenDoor(D4)",
    "GoThrough(D4)"
  ]
}

This plan takes you from CHAMBRE 2 through the HALL and directly to the WC using only the necessary doors. It's the most efficient route based on the floor plan provided.
