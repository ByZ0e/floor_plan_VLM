Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing out the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide the navigation plan.

Rooms and Doors:
- CUISINE: Connected to SEJOUR via D3
- SEJOUR: Connected to CUISINE via D3, to DEGT via D4
- DEGT: Connected to SEJOUR via D4, to CH.2 via D6
- CH.2: Connected to DEGT via D6

Now, for the navigation plan from CUISINE to CH.2:

{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(D3)",
    "OpenDoor(D3)",
    "GoThrough(D3)",
    "ApproachDoor(D4)",
    "OpenDoor(D4)",
    "GoThrough(D4)",
    "ApproachDoor(D6)",
    "OpenDoor(D6)",
    "GoThrough(D6)"
  ]
}

This plan will efficiently guide you from the CUISINE to CH.2 using only the necessary doors. The path goes through CUISINE -> SEJOUR -> DEGT -> CH.2, which is the most direct route based on the floor plan provided.
