Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing out the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide the navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
- CH.3 is connected to the large SEJOUR area via D1 and D2
- CH.2 is connected to the large SEJOUR area via D3
- CH.1 is connected to the large SEJOUR area via D4
- The CUISINE (kitchen) is connected to the large SEJOUR area via D6
- D5 appears to be an internal door within the SEJOUR area

Navigation Plan:
To get from CH.3 to CH.1, we need to go through the large SEJOUR area. Here's the efficient path:

{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(D2)",
    "OpenDoor(D2)",
    "GoThrough(D2)",
    "ApproachDoor(D4)",
    "OpenDoor(D4)",
    "GoThrough(D4)"
  ]
}

This plan takes you from CH.3 through D2 into the large SEJOUR area, and then directly to D4 to enter CH.1. It's the most efficient route as it uses the minimum number of doors necessary to reach the destination.
