Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide the navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
- CELLIER: Connected to GARAGE via D1, to WC via D3
- GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER via D1
- WC: Connected to CELLIER via D3, to HALL via D4
- DOUCHE: Connected to HALL via D2
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D5
- CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D6 and D7
- HALL: Central area connecting multiple rooms

Navigation Plan:
To go from CELLIER to HALL, the most efficient path is through the WC. Here's the detailed plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the CELLIER to the HALL using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
