Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide the navigation plan.

Rooms and Doors:
- CH.1: Connected to SEJOUR via D4
- CH.2: Connected to SEJOUR via D3
- CH.3: Connected to SEJOUR via D2 and D1
- SEJOUR: Central area connected to all rooms
- CUISINE: Connected to SEJOUR via D6 and D5

To navigate from CH.1 to CH.2, here's the efficient path:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"}
  ]
}
```

This path takes you from CH.1 through the SEJOUR area and directly into CH.2, using only the necessary doors D4 and D3. It avoids any unnecessary detours or additional doors, providing the most efficient route between the two rooms.
