Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide the navigation plan.

Rooms and Doors:
- CH.1: Connected to HALL via D1 and D2
- CH.2: Connected to HALL via D3
- BAINS: Connected to HALL via D1
- GARAGE: Connected to CUISINE via D4
- CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D5

Navigation Plan:
To go from CH.1 to GARAGE, we need to pass through the HALL and CUISINE. Here's the detailed plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from CH.1 to the GARAGE using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
