To begin, I'll list out the rooms and doors with their connections based on the floor plan:

Rooms and their connections:
1. GARAGE - connects to CELLIER via D1
2. CELLIER - connects to GARAGE via D1, PORCHE via D2, HALL via D11
3. PORCHE - connects to CELLIER via D2, HALL via D3
4. HALL - central area connecting multiple rooms
5. WC - connects to HALL via D4
6. LINGERIE - connects to HALL via D5
7. BUREAU - connects to HALL via D6
8. BAINS - connects to HALL via D7
9. CHAMBRE PARENTS - connects to HALL via D8
10. CHAMBRE ENFANT 2 - connects to HALL via D9
11. CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 - connects to HALL via D10

Now, for the navigation plan from GARAGE to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D10"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from the GARAGE to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
