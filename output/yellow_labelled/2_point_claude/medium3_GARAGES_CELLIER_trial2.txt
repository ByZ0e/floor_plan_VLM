Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide you with a navigation plan from the GARAGES to the CELLIER.

Rooms and Doors:
1. GARAGES - connected to CELLIER via D1
2. CELLIER - connected to GARAGES via D1, to CUISINE via D3
3. CUISINE - connected to CELLIER via D3, to HALL via D6
4. CHAMBRE 1 - connected to HALL via D5
5. DOUCHE - connected to HALL via D2
6. WC - connected to HALL via D4
7. HALL - central area connecting multiple rooms

Now, for the navigation plan from GARAGES to CELLIER:

The most efficient path is straightforward, as there's a direct connection between these two rooms.

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D1"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently guide you from the GARAGES to the CELLIER using the most direct route available.
