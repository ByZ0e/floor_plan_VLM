Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan to get from the PORCHE to the LINGERIE.

Rooms and Doors:
- PORCHE: Connected to CELLIER via D3
- CELLIER: Connected to PORCHE via D3, GARAGE via D1, HALL via D11
- GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER via D1
- HALL: Connected to CELLIER via D11, WC via D4, LINGERIE via D5
- WC: Connected to HALL via D4
- LINGERIE: Connected to HALL via D5

Navigation Plan:
To go from the PORCHE to the LINGERIE, we need to pass through the CELLIER and the HALL. Here's the detailed plan:

{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"}
  ]
}

This plan will efficiently guide you from the PORCHE to the LINGERIE using only the necessary doors along the path.
