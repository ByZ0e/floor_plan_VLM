I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan.

Rooms and Doors:
- GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER via D9
- CELLIER: Connected to GARAGE via D9, to HALL via D1
- HALL: Central area connecting multiple rooms
- BAINS: Connected to HALL via D2
- WC: Connected to HALL via D3
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D4
- CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL via D5
- PORCHE: Connected to HALL via D6
- CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D7
- TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE via D8

Navigation Plan:
To go from GARAGE to CHAMBRE 2, the most efficient path is:

1. ApproachDoor(D9)
2. OpenDoor(D9)
3. GoThrough(D9)
4. ApproachDoor(D1)
5. OpenDoor(D1)
6. GoThrough(D1)
7. ApproachDoor(D5)
8. OpenDoor(D5)
9. GoThrough(D5)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"}
  ]
}
```

This path takes you from the GARAGE, through the CELLIER, into the central HALL area, and finally into CHAMBRE 2, using only the necessary doors along the way.
