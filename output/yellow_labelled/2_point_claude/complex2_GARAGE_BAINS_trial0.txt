Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan as requested.

Rooms and Door Connections:
- GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER via D9
- CELLIER: Connected to GARAGE via D9, to HALL via D1
- CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL via D2
- PORCHE: Connected to HALL via D5
- CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D7 and D8
- TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE via D8
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D6
- BAINS: Connected to HALL via D3
- WC: Connected to HALL via D4

Navigation Plan:
To go from GARAGE to BAINS, here's the efficient path:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"}
  ]
}
```

This path takes you from the GARAGE, through the CELLIER, into the HALL, and finally into the BAINS, using only the necessary doors along the way.
