Let me start by listing out the rooms and doors with their connections based on the floor plan:

Rooms and their connections:
- CHAMBRE PARENTS: Connected to HALL via D8
- BAINS: Connected to HALL via D7
- BUREAU: Connected to HALL via D6
- LINGERIE: Connected to HALL via D5
- WC: Connected to HALL via D4
- HALL: Central area connecting multiple rooms
- CHAMBRE ENFANT 1: Connected to HALL via D10
- CHAMBRE ENFANT 2: Connected to HALL via D9
- CELLIER: Connected to HALL via D3, also connected to GARAGE via D2 and D1
- GARAGE: Large area with multiple connections

Doors:
D1: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER
D2: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER
D3: Connects CELLIER and HALL
D4: Connects WC and HALL
D5: Connects LINGERIE and HALL
D6: Connects BUREAU and HALL
D7: Connects BAINS and HALL
D8: Connects CHAMBRE PARENTS and HALL
D9: Connects CHAMBRE ENFANT 2 and HALL
D10: Connects CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 and HALL
D11: Connects CELLIER and HALL

Now, for the navigation plan from CHAMBRE PARENTS to CELLIER:

{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(D8)",
    "OpenDoor(D8)",
    "GoThrough(D8)",
    "ApproachDoor(D3)",
    "OpenDoor(D3)",
    "GoThrough(D3)"
  ]
}

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from CHAMBRE PARENTS to CELLIER using only the necessary doors. The robot will exit the CHAMBRE PARENTS through D8, enter the HALL, and then enter the CELLIER through D3.
