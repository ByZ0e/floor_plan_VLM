Certainly! I'll start by listing out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan in JSON format.

Room and Door Connections:

1. GARAGES: Connected to CELLIER via D1
2. CELLIER: Connected to GARAGES via D1, to CUISINE via D3
3. CUISINE: Connected to CELLIER via D3, to HALL via D6
4. WC: Connected to HALL via D4
5. DOUCHE: Connected to HALL via D2
6. CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D5
7. HALL: Central area connecting multiple rooms

Navigation Plan:

The path from GARAGES to CELLIER is straightforward, requiring only one door (D1). Here's the plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the GARAGES to the CELLIER using the most direct path available. The plan avoids any unnecessary doors or rooms, ensuring you reach your destination in the most straightforward manner possible.
