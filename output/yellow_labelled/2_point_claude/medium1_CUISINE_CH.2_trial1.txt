Thank you for providing the floor plan. Let me first list out the rooms and doors with their connections for reference:

Rooms:
- CELLIER
- CUISINE
- SEJOUR (large room)
- DEGT (small hallway)
- CH.1
- CH.2 (large room)
- BAINS
- WC

Doors:
D1: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
D2: Connects CELLIER and CUISINE
D3: Connects CUISINE and SEJOUR
D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
D5: Connects DEGT and CH.1
D6: Connects DEGT and CH.2
D7: Connects DEGT and BAINS
D8: Connects DEGT and WC

Now, for the navigation plan from CUISINE to CH.2:

The most efficient path would be:

1. Start in CUISINE
2. Use D3 to enter SEJOUR
3. Cross SEJOUR to D4
4. Enter DEGT through D4
5. Use D6 to enter CH.2

Here's the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D3"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D3"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D3"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D6"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D6"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D6"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan ensures you navigate efficiently from the CUISINE to CH.2 using only the necessary doors along the path.
