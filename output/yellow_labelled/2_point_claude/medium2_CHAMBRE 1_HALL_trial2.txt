Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan in JSON format.

Room and Door Connections:
- CHAMBRE 1 connects to HALL via D2
- HALL connects to CHAMBRE 2 via D6
- HALL connects to CHAMBRE 3 via D5
- HALL connects to BAINS via D4
- HALL connects to CELLIER via D7
- HALL connects to Porche via D8
- GARAGE connects to CELLIER via D1

Navigation Plan:
To navigate from CHAMBRE 1 to HALL, we only need to use one door: D2. Here's the plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D2"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D2"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D2"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently take you from CHAMBRE 1 to HALL using only the necessary door D2. No other doors need to be used for this particular navigation task.
