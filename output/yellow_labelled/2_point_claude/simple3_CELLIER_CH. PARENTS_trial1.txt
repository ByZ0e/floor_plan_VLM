Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors, and then provide you with an efficient navigation plan from the CELLIER to CH. PARENTS.

Rooms and Doors:
- CELLIER: Connected to the larger CUISINE area by door D2
- CUISINE (large central area): Connected to CELLIER by D2, to TERRASSE COUVERTE by D1, and to CH. PARENTS by D3
- TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE by D1
- CH. PARENTS: Connected to CUISINE by D3, and to DOUCHE by D4
- DOUCHE: Connected to CH. PARENTS by D4

Now, for the navigation plan from CELLIER to CH. PARENTS:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D2"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D2"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D2"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D3"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D3"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D3"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from the CELLIER to CH. PARENTS, using only the necessary doors (D2 and D3) and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors. The robot will start in the CELLIER, move through the CUISINE area, and finally arrive at CH. PARENTS.
