Certainly! I'll start by listing out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan in JSON format.

Rooms and Doors:
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D4
- HALL: Central area connecting multiple rooms
- CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL via D5
- BAINS: Connected to HALL via D2
- WC: Connected to HALL via D3
- CELLIER: Connected to HALL via D1
- GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER via D9
- CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D7
- PORCHE: Connected to HALL via D6
- TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE via D8

Navigation Plan:
To go from CHAMBRE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE, the most efficient path is:
CHAMBRE 1 -> HALL -> CUISINE -> TERRASSE COUVERTE

Here's the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently guides you from CHAMBRE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE using only the necessary doors (D4, D7, and D8) and avoiding any unnecessary detours or rooms.
