Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors, and then provide you with the navigation plan to go from the PORCHE to the LINGERIE.

Rooms and their connections:
- PORCHE: Connected to CELLIER via D3
- CELLIER: Connected to PORCHE via D3, GARAGE via D1, HALL via D11
- GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER via D1
- HALL: Connected to CELLIER via D11, WC via D4, LINGERIE via D5
- WC: Connected to HALL via D4
- LINGERIE: Connected to HALL via D5

Doors:
D1: Between GARAGE and CELLIER
D2: Not clearly connected to any rooms (appears to be within CELLIER)
D3: Between PORCHE and CELLIER
D4: Between HALL and WC
D5: Between HALL and LINGERIE
D6-D11: Not relevant for this navigation task

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan from PORCHE to LINGERIE:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently guide you from the PORCHE to the LINGERIE using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
