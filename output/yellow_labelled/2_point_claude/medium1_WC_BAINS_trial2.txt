First, let me list out the rooms and doors with their connections based on the floor plan:

Rooms:
- WC
- BAINS
- DEGT
- CH.2
- CH.1
- SEJOUR
- CUISINE
- CELLIER

Doors:
D1: Connects SEJOUR to PORCHE (outside)
D2: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
D3: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
D4: Connects SEJOUR to DEGT
D5: Connects CH.1 to DEGT
D6: Connects CH.2 to DEGT
D7: Connects BAINS to DEGT
D8: Connects WC to DEGT

Now, for the navigation plan from WC to BAINS:

The most efficient path from WC to BAINS is straightforward, as these two rooms are adjacent and both connected to the DEGT (hallway). We only need to use one door (D8) to exit the WC and then approach the BAINS door (D7).

Here's the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D8"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D8"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D8"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D7"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the WC to the BAINS using only the necessary doors. Note that we don't include opening or going through D7 (the BAINS door) as the task only requires arriving at BAINS, not entering it.
