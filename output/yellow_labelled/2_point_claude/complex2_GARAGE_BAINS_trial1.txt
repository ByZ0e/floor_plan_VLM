Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan as requested.

Rooms and Doors:
- Garage: Connected to Cellier via D9
- Cellier: Connected to Garage via D9, to Hall via D1
- Chambre 2: Connected to Hall via D2
- Porche: Connected to Hall via D5
- Cuisine: Connected to Hall via D7, to Terrasse Couverte via D8
- Chambre 1: Connected to Hall via D6
- Bains: Connected to Hall via D3
- WC: Connected to Hall via D4
- Hall: Central area connecting multiple rooms
- Terrasse Couverte: Connected to Cuisine via D8

Now, for the navigation plan from Garage to Bains:

{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"}
  ]
}

This plan efficiently navigates from the Garage to the Bains using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
