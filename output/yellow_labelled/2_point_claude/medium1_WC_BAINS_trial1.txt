Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors, and then provide the navigation plan as requested.

Rooms and their connections:
1. WC - connected to DEGT via D8
2. BAINS - connected to DEGT via D7
3. DEGT - connected to WC (D8), BAINS (D7), CH.2 (D6), and SEJOUR (D4)
4. SEJOUR - connected to DEGT (D4) and CUISINE (D3)
5. CUISINE - connected to SEJOUR (D3) and CELLIER (D2)
6. CELLIER - connected to CUISINE (D2)
7. CH.1 - connected to SEJOUR (D5)
8. CH.2 - connected to DEGT (D6)

Doors:
D1 - Not relevant for this path
D2 - Between CUISINE and CELLIER
D3 - Between CUISINE and SEJOUR
D4 - Between SEJOUR and DEGT
D5 - Between SEJOUR and CH.1
D6 - Between DEGT and CH.2
D7 - Between DEGT and BAINS
D8 - Between DEGT and WC

Now, for the navigation plan from WC to BAINS:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the WC to the BAINS using only the necessary doors (D8 and D7) and passing through the DEGT room, which connects these two areas.
