Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan from the GARAGE to the BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
- GARAGE: connected to CHAMBRE 1 via D1
- CHAMBRE 1: connected to GARAGE via D1, to HALL via D2
- CELLIER: connected to HALL via D7
- HALL: connected to CHAMBRE 1 via D2, to CELLIER via D7, to Porche via D8, to WC via D3, to CHAMBRE 3 via D4, to CHAMBRE 2 via D6
- WC: connected to HALL via D3
- BAINS: connected to HALL via D4
- CHAMBRE 3: connected to HALL via D4
- CHAMBRE 2: connected to HALL via D6

Navigation Plan:
To go from the GARAGE to the BAINS, we need to pass through CHAMBRE 1 and the HALL. Here's the detailed plan:

{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(D1)",
    "OpenDoor(D1)",
    "GoThrough(D1)",
    "ApproachDoor(D2)",
    "OpenDoor(D2)",
    "GoThrough(D2)",
    "ApproachDoor(D4)",
    "OpenDoor(D4)",
    "GoThrough(D4)"
  ]
}

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the GARAGE to the BAINS using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
