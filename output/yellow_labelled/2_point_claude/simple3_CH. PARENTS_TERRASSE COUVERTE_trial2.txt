Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout and provide you with a detailed navigation plan as requested. First, let me list out the rooms and doors with their connections:

Rooms:
1. CH. PARENTS
2. DOUCHE
3. CUISINE (large central area)
4. CELLIER
5. TERRASSE COUVERTE

Doors:
D1: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE to CUISINE
D2: Connects CELLIER to CUISINE
D3: Connects CUISINE to DOUCHE
D4: Connects DOUCHE to CH. PARENTS

Now, for the navigation plan from CH. PARENTS to TERRASSE COUVERTE:

{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "target": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "target": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "target": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "target": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "target": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "target": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "target": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "target": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "target": "D1"}
  ]
}

This plan provides the most efficient route from CH. PARENTS to TERRASSE COUVERTE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
