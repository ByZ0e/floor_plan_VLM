Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first describe the rooms and doors, then provide the navigation plan.

Room and Door Descriptions:
- CUISINE: Large central room connected to TERRASSE COUVERTE, CELLIER, and CH. PARENTS
- CELLIER: Small room connected to CUISINE
- TERRASSE COUVERTE: Outdoor area connected to CUISINE
- CH. PARENTS: Bedroom connected to CUISINE and DOUCHE
- DOUCHE: Bathroom connected to CH. PARENTS

Doors:
D1: Between CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
D2: Between CUISINE and CELLIER
D3: Between CUISINE and CH. PARENTS
D4: Between CH. PARENTS and DOUCHE

Navigation Plan:
To go from CUISINE to DOUCHE, we need to pass through CH. PARENTS. Here's the efficient path:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the CUISINE to the DOUCHE using only the necessary doors (D3 and D4) and passing through the CH. PARENTS room.
