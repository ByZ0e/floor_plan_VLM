Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing out the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide the navigation plan.

Rooms and Doors:
- HALL (main hall area)
- CH.1 (connected to HALL via D2)
- CH.2 (connected to HALL via D3)
- BAINS (connected to HALL via D1)
- GARAGE (connected to CUISINE via D4)
- CUISINE (connected to HALL via D5)

Navigation Plan:
To get from the HALL to the CUISINE, we only need to use one door: D5. Here's the detailed plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D5"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D5"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D5"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan is efficient and uses only the necessary door to reach the CUISINE from the HALL. The robot will approach D5, open it, and go through to enter the CUISINE.
