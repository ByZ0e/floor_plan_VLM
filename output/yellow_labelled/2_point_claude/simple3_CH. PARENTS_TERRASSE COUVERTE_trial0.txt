Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze it and provide you with a detailed navigation plan as requested. First, let me list out the rooms and doors with their connections:

Rooms and their connections:
1. CH. PARENTS: Connected to CUISINE via D3 and D4
2. DOUCHE: Connected to CUISINE via D4
3. CUISINE (large central area): Connected to CH. PARENTS via D3, DOUCHE via D4, CELLIER via D2, and TERRASSE COUVERTE via D1
4. CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE via D2
5. TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE via D1

Doors:
D1: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
D2: Connects CUISINE to CELLIER
D3: Connects CUISINE to CH. PARENTS
D4: Connects CUISINE to DOUCHE and CH. PARENTS

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan to go from CH. PARENTS to TERRASSE COUVERTE:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently guide you from CH. PARENTS to TERRASSE COUVERTE using the necessary doors. You'll start by exiting CH. PARENTS through D3 into the CUISINE area, then cross the CUISINE to reach D1, which leads directly to TERRASSE COUVERTE.
