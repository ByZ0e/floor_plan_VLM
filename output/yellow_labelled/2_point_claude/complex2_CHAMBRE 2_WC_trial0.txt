Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout and provide you with a detailed navigation plan as requested. First, let me list out the rooms and doors with their connections:

Rooms and their connections:
- CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL via D2
- HALL: Central area connecting multiple rooms
- WC: Connected to HALL via D4

Doors:
D2: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to HALL
D4: Connects HALL to WC

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan to go from CHAMBRE 2 to WC:

{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(D2)",
    "OpenDoor(D2)",
    "GoThrough(D2)",
    "ApproachDoor(D4)",
    "OpenDoor(D4)",
    "GoThrough(D4)"
  ]
}

This plan will efficiently guide you from CHAMBRE 2 to the WC using only the necessary doors. The path avoids any unnecessary rooms or doors, providing a direct route through the HALL to reach your destination.
