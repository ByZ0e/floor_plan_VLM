Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first describe the rooms and doors, then provide the navigation plan.

Room and Door Descriptions:
- CH.1, CH.2, and CH.3 are bedrooms
- There are multiple areas labeled SEJOUR (living room/lounge)
- CUISINE is the kitchen
- D1 connects CH.3 to the SEJOUR
- D2 connects CH.3 to CH.2
- D3 connects CH.2 to the SEJOUR
- D4 connects CH.1 to the SEJOUR
- D5 connects the CUISINE to the SEJOUR
- D6 connects the CUISINE to another part of the SEJOUR

For the navigation task from CH.2 to SEJOUR, here's the efficient plan:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"}
  ]
}
```

This plan is the most direct and efficient route from CH.2 to SEJOUR. It only requires using one door (D3), which directly connects CH.2 to the SEJOUR area. There's no need to go through any other rooms or use any other doors for this particular navigation task.
