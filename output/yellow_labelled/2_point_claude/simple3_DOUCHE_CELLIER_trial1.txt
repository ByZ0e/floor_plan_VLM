Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
- DOUCHE: Connected to CUISINE via D4
- CUISINE: Connected to CH. PARENTS via D3, to CELLIER via D2, and to TERRASSE COUVERTE via D1
- CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE via D2
- CH. PARENTS: Connected to CUISINE via D3
- TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE via D1

Now, for the navigation plan from DOUCHE to CELLIER:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the DOUCHE to the CELLIER using only the necessary doors (D4 and D2) and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
