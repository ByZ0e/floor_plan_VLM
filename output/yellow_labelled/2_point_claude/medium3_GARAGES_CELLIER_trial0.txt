Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide you with an efficient navigation plan from the GARAGES to the CELLIER.

Rooms and Doors:
- GARAGES: Connected to CELLIER via D1
- CELLIER: Connected to GARAGES via D1, to CUISINE via D3
- CUISINE: Connected to CELLIER via D3, to HALL via D6
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D5
- DOUCHE: Connected to HALL via D2
- WC: Connected to HALL via D4
- HALL: Central area connecting multiple rooms

Now, let's create the navigation plan from GARAGES to CELLIER:

{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"}
  ]
}

This plan is the most efficient route from the GARAGES to the CELLIER. It involves only one door (D1) which directly connects these two areas. The robot will approach D1 from the GARAGES side, open it, and then go through to enter the CELLIER, thus completing the navigation task.
