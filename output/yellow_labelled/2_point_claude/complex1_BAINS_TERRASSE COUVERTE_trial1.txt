Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide an efficient navigation plan from BAINS to TERRASSE COUVERTE.

Rooms and Doors:
- BAINS: Connected to HALL via D2
- WC: Connected to HALL via D3
- CELLIER: Connected to HALL via D1
- GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER via D9
- CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL via D5
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D4
- CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D7
- PORCHE: Connected to HALL via D6
- TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE via D8

Navigation Plan:
To go from BAINS to TERRASSE COUVERTE, we need to pass through the HALL and CUISINE. Here's the efficient path:

{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(D2)",
    "OpenDoor(D2)",
    "GoThrough(D2)",
    "ApproachDoor(D7)",
    "OpenDoor(D7)",
    "GoThrough(D7)",
    "ApproachDoor(D8)",
    "OpenDoor(D8)",
    "GoThrough(D8)"
  ]
}

This path takes you from BAINS to HALL (via D2), then from HALL to CUISINE (via D7), and finally from CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE (via D8). It's the most direct and efficient route based on the floor plan provided.
