Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the CUISINE to CH.1.

Rooms and Doors:
- CUISINE: Connected to GARAGE via D4, to HALL via D5
- GARAGE: Connected to CUISINE via D4
- HALL: Central area connecting multiple rooms
- CH.2: Connected to HALL via D3
- CH.1: Connected to HALL via D2
- BAINS: Connected to HALL via D1

Navigation Plan:
To go from CUISINE to CH.1, we need to use doors D5 and D2. Here's the detailed plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the CUISINE to CH.1 using only the necessary doors. You'll start by exiting the CUISINE through D5 into the HALL, then proceed to enter CH.1 through D2.
