Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan.

Rooms and Doors:
- CH.1: Connected to SEJOUR via D4
- CH.2: Connected to SEJOUR via D3
- CH.3: Connected to SEJOUR via D2 and D1
- SEJOUR: Large central area connected to all other rooms
- CUISINE: Connected to SEJOUR via D6 and D5

Now, for the navigation plan from CH.1 to CH.2:

The most efficient path from CH.1 to CH.2 is through the SEJOUR area. Here's the detailed plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently guide you from CH.1 to CH.2 using only the necessary doors (D4 and D3) and passing through the SEJOUR area. The plan avoids any unnecessary doors or rooms, providing the most direct path between the start and end points.
