Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing out the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide the navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
- CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL via D2
- HALL: Central area connecting multiple rooms
- WC: Connected to HALL via D4

Navigation Plan:
To go from CHAMBRE 2 to WC, we need to use two doors: D2 and D4. Here's the detailed plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from CHAMBRE 2 to the WC using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
