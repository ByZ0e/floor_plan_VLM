Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout and provide you with a detailed navigation plan as requested. First, let me list out the rooms and doors with their connections:

Rooms and Connections:
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D2
- HALL: Central area connecting multiple rooms
- GARAGE: Connected to HALL via D1
- CELLIER: Connected to HALL via D7
- BAINS: Connected to HALL via D4
- CHAMBRE 3: Connected to HALL via D5
- CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL via D6
- Porche: Connected to HALL via D8

Now, for the navigation plan from CHAMBRE 1 to HALL:

The path is straightforward as CHAMBRE 1 is directly connected to HALL through door D2. Here's the efficient navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CHAMBRE 1",
  "end": "HALL",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from CHAMBRE 1 to HALL using the most direct route available. You'll approach door D2, open it, and go through it to enter the HALL area.
