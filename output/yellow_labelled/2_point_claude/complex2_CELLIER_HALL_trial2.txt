Navigation Plan:
To navigate from the CELLIER to the HALL, we only need to use one door: D1. Here's the detailed plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D1"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently take you from the CELLIER to the HALL using the most direct route available.
