Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan.

Rooms and Doors:
- CUISINE (main area)
- CELLIER (connected to CUISINE via D2)
- TERRASSE COUVERTE (connected to CUISINE via D1)
- CH. PARENTS (connected to CUISINE via D3)
- DOUCHE (connected to CH. PARENTS via D4)

Navigation Plan:
To go from CUISINE to DOUCHE, we need to pass through CH. PARENTS. Here's the efficient path:

{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(D3)",
    "OpenDoor(D3)",
    "GoThrough(D3)",
    "ApproachDoor(D4)",
    "OpenDoor(D4)",
    "GoThrough(D4)"
  ]
}

This plan will take you from the CUISINE, through CH. PARENTS, and finally to the DOUCHE in the most efficient manner, using only the necessary doors.
