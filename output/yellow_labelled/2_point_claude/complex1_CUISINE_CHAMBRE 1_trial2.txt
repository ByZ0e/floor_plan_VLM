Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan to get from the CUISINE to CHAMBRE 1.

Rooms and Doors:
- CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D7
- HALL: Central area connecting multiple rooms
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D4
- CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL via D5
- BAINS: Connected to HALL via D2
- WC: Connected to HALL via D3
- CELLIER: Connected to HALL via D1
- GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER via D9
- PORCHE: Connected to HALL via D6
- TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE via D8

Navigation Plan:
To get from the CUISINE to CHAMBRE 1, you need to go through the HALL. Here's the detailed plan:

{
  "plan": [
    "ApproachDoor(D7)",
    "OpenDoor(D7)",
    "GoThrough(D7)",
    "ApproachDoor(D4)",
    "OpenDoor(D4)",
    "GoThrough(D4)"
  ]
}

This plan will efficiently take you from the CUISINE to CHAMBRE 1 using only the necessary doors. You'll start by exiting the CUISINE through D7 into the HALL, then proceed to enter CHAMBRE 1 through D4.
