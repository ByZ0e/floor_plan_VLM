Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan.

Rooms and Doors:
- CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE via D2
- CUISINE: Large central area, connected to CELLIER (D2), TERRASSE COUVERTE (D1), and CH. PARENTS (D3)
- TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE via D1
- CH. PARENTS: Connected to CUISINE via D3 and to DOUCHE via D4
- DOUCHE: Connected to CH. PARENTS via D4

Navigation Plan:
To go from CELLIER to CH. PARENTS, we need to use two doors: D2 and D3. Here's the detailed plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "target": "D2"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "target": "D2"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "target": "D2"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "target": "D3"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "target": "D3"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "target": "D3"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently guide you from the CELLIER to CH. PARENTS using only the necessary doors (D2 and D3) and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
