Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide the navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D5
- HALL: Connected to CHAMBRE 1 (D5), WC (D4), DOUCHE (D2), CUISINE (D6)
- WC: Connected to HALL via D4
- DOUCHE: Connected to HALL via D2
- CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D6, CELLIER via D3
- CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE via D3, GARAGES via D1
- GARAGES: Connected to CELLIER via D1

Now, for the navigation plan from CHAMBRE 1 to GARAGES:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from CHAMBRE 1 to GARAGES, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
