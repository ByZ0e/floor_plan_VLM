Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors, and then provide the navigation plan as requested.

Rooms and Doors:
- GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER via D9
- CELLIER: Connected to GARAGE via D9, to HALL via D1
- HALL: Central area connecting multiple rooms
- BAINS: Connected to HALL via D2
- WC: Connected to HALL via D3
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D4
- CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL via D5
- PORCHE: Connected to HALL via D6
- CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D7
- TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE via D8

Navigation Plan:
To go from GARAGE to CHAMBRE 2, the most efficient path is:

{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(D9)",
    "OpenDoor(D9)",
    "GoThrough(D9)",
    "ApproachDoor(D1)",
    "OpenDoor(D1)",
    "GoThrough(D1)",
    "ApproachDoor(D5)",
    "OpenDoor(D5)",
    "GoThrough(D5)"
  ]
}

This plan takes you from the GARAGE, through the CELLIER, into the central HALL area, and finally into CHAMBRE 2, using only the necessary doors along the most direct route.
