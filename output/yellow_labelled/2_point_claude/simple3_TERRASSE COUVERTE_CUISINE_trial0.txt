Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide the navigation plan.

Rooms and Doors:
- TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE via D1
- CUISINE (main area): Connected to TERRASSE COUVERTE via D1, to upper CUISINE via D2, to CH. PARENTS via D3
- Upper CUISINE (small area): Connected to main CUISINE via D2, has CELLIER
- CH. PARENTS: Connected to CUISINE via D3, to DOUCHE via D4
- DOUCHE: Connected to CH. PARENTS via D4

Now, for the navigation plan from TERRASSE COUVERTE to CUISINE:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"}
  ]
}
```

This plan is the most efficient path from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to the CUISINE. It involves only one door (D1) which directly connects these two areas. The robot will approach D1, open it, and go through to reach the CUISINE.
