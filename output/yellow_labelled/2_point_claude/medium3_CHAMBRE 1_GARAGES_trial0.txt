Certainly! I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
- CHAMBRE 1 connects to HALL via D5
- HALL connects to WC via D4
- HALL connects to DOUCHE via D2
- HALL connects to CUISINE via D6
- CUISINE connects to CELLIER via D3
- CELLIER connects to GARAGES via D1

Now, for the navigation plan from CHAMBRE 1 to GARAGES:

{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(D5)",
    "OpenDoor(D5)",
    "GoThrough(D5)",
    "ApproachDoor(D6)",
    "OpenDoor(D6)",
    "GoThrough(D6)",
    "ApproachDoor(D3)",
    "OpenDoor(D3)",
    "GoThrough(D3)",
    "ApproachDoor(D1)",
    "OpenDoor(D1)",
    "GoThrough(D1)"
  ]
}

This path takes you from CHAMBRE 1 through the HALL, into the CUISINE, then through the CELLIER, and finally into the GARAGES. It uses the minimum number of doors necessary to reach the destination efficiently.
