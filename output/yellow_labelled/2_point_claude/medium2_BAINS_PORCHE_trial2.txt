Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan to go from BAINS to PORCHE.

Room and Door Connections:
- BAINS connects to HALL via D4
- HALL connects to CHAMBRE 1 via D2
- HALL connects to CHAMBRE 2 via D6
- HALL connects to CHAMBRE 3 via D5
- HALL connects to CELLIER via D7
- HALL connects to PORCHE via D8
- GARAGE connects to CELLIER via D1

Navigation Plan:
To go from BAINS to PORCHE, we need to use the following path:
BAINS -> D4 -> HALL -> D8 -> PORCHE

Here's the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from BAINS to PORCHE, using only the necessary doors (D4 and D8) and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
