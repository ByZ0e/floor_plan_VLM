Certainly! I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan in JSON format.

Room and Door Connections:
- Cuisine: Connected to Hall via D7
- Hall: Central area connecting multiple rooms
- Chambre 1: Connected to Hall via D4
- Chambre 2: Connected to Hall via D5
- Bains: Connected to Hall via D2
- WC: Connected to Hall via D3
- Porche: Connected to Hall via D6
- Cellier: Connected to Hall via D1
- Garage: Connected to Cellier via D9
- Terrasse Couverte: Connected to Hall via D8

Now, for the navigation plan from Cuisine to Chambre 1:

{
  "path": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D7"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D7"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D7"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D4"
    }
  ]
}

This plan provides the most efficient path from the Cuisine to Chambre 1, using only the necessary doors (D7 and D4) and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors. The robot will exit the Cuisine through D7 into the Hall, then proceed directly to Chambre 1 through D4.
