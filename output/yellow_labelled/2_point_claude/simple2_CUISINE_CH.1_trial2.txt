Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze it and provide you with a detailed navigation plan as requested. First, let me list out the rooms and doors with their connections:

Rooms and their connections:
- CUISINE: Connected to GARAGE via D4, connected to HALL via D5
- GARAGE: Connected to CUISINE via D4
- HALL: Central area connecting multiple rooms
- CH.2: Connected to HALL via D3
- CH.1: Connected to HALL via D2
- BAINS: Connected to HALL via D1

Doors and their connections:
- D1: Connects BAINS to HALL
- D2: Connects CH.1 to HALL
- D3: Connects CH.2 to HALL
- D4: Connects GARAGE to CUISINE
- D5: Connects CUISINE to HALL

Now, for the navigation plan from CUISINE to CH.1:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "target": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "target": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "target": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "target": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "target": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "target": "D2"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the CUISINE to CH.1 using only the necessary doors. You'll start by exiting the CUISINE through D5 into the HALL, then proceed directly to CH.1 through D2.
