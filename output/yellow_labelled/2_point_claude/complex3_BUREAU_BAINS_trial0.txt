First, let me describe the rooms and doors as shown in the floor plan:

Rooms:
- BUREAU
- BAINS
- LINGERIE
- CHAMBRE PARENTS
- CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
- CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
- GARAGE
- CELLIER (multiple)
- HALL (multiple)
- PORCHE
- WC

Doors:
D1: Between GARAGE and CELLIER
D2: Between CELLIER and PORCHE
D3: Between PORCHE and HALL
D4: Between HALL and WC
D5: Between LINGERIE and HALL
D6: Between BUREAU and HALL
D7: Between BAINS and HALL
D8: Between CHAMBRE PARENTS and HALL
D9: Between HALL and another HALL section
D10: Between CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 and HALL
D11: Between CELLIER and HALL

Now, for the navigation plan from BUREAU to BAINS:

{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(D6)",
    "OpenDoor(D6)",
    "GoThrough(D6)",
    "ApproachDoor(D7)",
    "OpenDoor(D7)",
    "GoThrough(D7)"
  ]
}

This path is the most direct and efficient route from the BUREAU to the BAINS, using only the necessary doors (D6 and D7) that are part of the path being used.
