Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan to get from the HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2.

Rooms and Doors:
- HALL: Connected to D5, D6, D7, D8, D9, D10, D11
- LINGERIE: Connected to D4, D5
- BUREAU: Connected to D5, D6
- BAINS: Connected to D6, D7
- CHAMBRE PARENTS: Connected to D8
- CHAMBRE ENFANT 1: Connected to D10
- CHAMBRE ENFANT 2: Connected to D9
- CELLIER: Connected to D1, D2, D3, D11
- WC: Connected to D4
- GARAGE: Connected to D1

Navigation Plan:
To get from the HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2, we only need to use one door: D9. Here's the detailed plan:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D9"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D9"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D9"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently take you from the HALL directly to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2 using only the necessary door D9. No other doors or rooms need to be traversed for this particular route.
