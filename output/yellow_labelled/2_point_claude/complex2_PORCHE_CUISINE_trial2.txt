I'll start by listing out the rooms and doors with their connections based on the floor plan:

Rooms and their connections:
- PORCHE: Connected to HALL via D5
- HALL: Central area connecting multiple rooms
- CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D7
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D6
- CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL via D2
- BAINS: Connected to HALL via D3
- WC: Connected to HALL via D4
- CELLIER: Connected to GARAGE via D9, and to HALL via D1
- GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER via D9
- TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE via D8

Now, for the navigation plan from PORCHE to CUISINE:

{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(D5)",
    "OpenDoor(D5)",
    "GoThrough(D5)",
    "ApproachDoor(D7)",
    "OpenDoor(D7)",
    "GoThrough(D7)"
  ]
}

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from the PORCHE to the CUISINE. It involves going through the HALL, which connects these two rooms. The plan avoids any unnecessary doors or rooms, ensuring a straightforward path to the destination.
