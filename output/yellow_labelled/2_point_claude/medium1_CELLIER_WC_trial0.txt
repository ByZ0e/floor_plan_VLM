Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan as requested.

Rooms and Doors:
- CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE via D2
- CUISINE: Connected to CELLIER via D2, to SEJOUR via D3
- SEJOUR: Connected to CUISINE via D3, to DEGT via D4
- DEGT: Connected to SEJOUR via D4, to CH.2 via D6, to BAINS via D7
- CH.1: Connected to DEGT via D5
- CH.2: Connected to DEGT via D6
- BAINS: Connected to DEGT via D7, to WC via D8
- WC: Connected to BAINS via D8

Now, for the navigation plan from CELLIER to WC:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"}
  ]
}
```

This path takes you from the CELLIER through the CUISINE, SEJOUR, DEGT, and BAINS to finally reach the WC. It's the most efficient route based on the floor plan provided.
