Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide the navigation plan.

Rooms and Doors:
- CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE via D2
- CUISINE: Connected to CELLIER via D2, to SEJOUR via D3
- SEJOUR: Connected to CUISINE via D3, to DEGT via D4
- DEGT: Connected to SEJOUR via D4, to CH.2 via D6, to BAINS via D7
- CH.1: Connected to DEGT via D5
- CH.2: Connected to DEGT via D6
- BAINS: Connected to DEGT via D7, to WC via D8
- WC: Connected to BAINS via D8

Now, for the navigation plan from CELLIER to WC:

{
  "plan": [
    "ApproachDoor(D2)",
    "OpenDoor(D2)",
    "GoThrough(D2)",
    "ApproachDoor(D3)",
    "OpenDoor(D3)",
    "GoThrough(D3)",
    "ApproachDoor(D4)",
    "OpenDoor(D4)",
    "GoThrough(D4)",
    "ApproachDoor(D7)",
    "OpenDoor(D7)",
    "GoThrough(D7)",
    "ApproachDoor(D8)",
    "OpenDoor(D8)",
    "GoThrough(D8)"
  ]
}

This plan will efficiently guide you from the CELLIER to the WC using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
