Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan.

Rooms and Doors:
- SEJOUR (main living area, connects to all other rooms)
- CH.1 (connects to SEJOUR via D4)
- CH.2 (connects to SEJOUR via D3)
- CH.3 (connects to SEJOUR via D2 and D1)
- CUISINE (connects to SEJOUR via D6 and D5)

Doors:
D1: Connects CH.3 to SEJOUR
D2: Connects CH.3 to SEJOUR
D3: Connects CH.2 to SEJOUR
D4: Connects CH.1 to SEJOUR
D5: Connects CUISINE to SEJOUR
D6: Connects CUISINE to SEJOUR

Now, for the navigation plan from SEJOUR to CUISINE:

The most efficient path is to use either D5 or D6, as both directly connect SEJOUR to CUISINE. I'll choose D6 for this plan.

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D6"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D6"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D6"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the SEJOUR to the CUISINE using the most direct route available.
