Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan as requested.

Rooms and Doors:

DEGT: Connected to SEJOUR (D4), CH.2 (D6), and BAINS (D7)
SEJOUR: Connected to DEGT (D4), CUISINE (D3), and outside (D1)
CUISINE: Connected to SEJOUR (D3) and CELLIER (D2)
CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE (D2)
CH.1: Connected to SEJOUR (D5)
CH.2: Connected to DEGT (D6)
BAINS: Connected to DEGT (D7)
WC: Connected to BAINS (D8)
PORCHE: Connected to SEJOUR (D1)

Now, for the navigation plan from DEGT to PORCHE:

{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(D4)",
    "OpenDoor(D4)",
    "GoThrough(D4)",
    "ApproachDoor(D1)",
    "OpenDoor(D1)",
    "GoThrough(D1)"
  ]
}

This plan takes you from DEGT through the SEJOUR and directly to the PORCHE using the most efficient path. It avoids any unnecessary doors or rooms.
