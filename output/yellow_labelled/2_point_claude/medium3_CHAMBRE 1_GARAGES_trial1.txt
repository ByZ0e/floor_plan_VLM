Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide an efficient navigation plan from CHAMBRE 1 to GARAGES.

Rooms and Doors:
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D5
- HALL: Central area connecting multiple rooms
- CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D6 and D7
- CELLIER: Connected to HALL via D3
- WC: Connected to HALL via D4
- DOUCHE: Connected to HALL via D2
- GARAGES: Connected to HALL via D1

Now, let's create the navigation plan from CHAMBRE 1 to GARAGES:

{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"}
  ]
}

This plan provides the most efficient route from CHAMBRE 1 to GARAGES. It involves exiting CHAMBRE 1 through door D5 into the HALL, then moving through the HALL to door D1, which leads directly to the GARAGES. This path avoids any unnecessary doors or rooms, ensuring a direct and efficient route to the destination.
