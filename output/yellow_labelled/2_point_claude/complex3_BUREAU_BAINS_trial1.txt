Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan from BUREAU to BAINS.

Rooms and Doors:
- BUREAU: Connected to HALL via D6
- BAINS: Connected to HALL via D7
- HALL: Central area connecting multiple rooms

Doors:
D6: Connects BUREAU to HALL
D7: Connects BAINS to HALL

Now, for the navigation plan from BUREAU to BAINS:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the BUREAU to the BAINS using only the necessary doors. It starts by exiting the BUREAU through D6 into the HALL, then enters the BAINS through D7. The plan avoids any unnecessary rooms or doors, providing a direct path between the start and end points.
