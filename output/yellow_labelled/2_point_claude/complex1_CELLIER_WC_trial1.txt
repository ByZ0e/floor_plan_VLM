Certainly! I'll start by describing the rooms and doors, then provide the navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Descriptions:
- CELLIER: Connected to HALL via D1
- GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER via D9
- BAINS: Connected to HALL via D2
- WC: Connected to HALL via D3
- CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL via D5
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D4
- PORCHE: Connected to HALL via D6
- CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D7
- TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE via D8

Now, for the navigation plan from CELLIER to WC:

The most efficient path from CELLIER to WC is:
1. Exit CELLIER through D1 to enter HALL
2. From HALL, enter WC through D3

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D3"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D3"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D3"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the CELLIER to the WC using only the necessary doors (D1 and D3) and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
