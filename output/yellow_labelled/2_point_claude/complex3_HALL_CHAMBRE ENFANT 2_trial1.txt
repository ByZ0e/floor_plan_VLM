Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the connections and provide you with an efficient navigation plan to get from the HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2.

Room and Door Connections:
- HALL connects to LINGERIE via D4
- HALL connects to BUREAU via D5
- HALL connects to BAINS via D7
- HALL connects to CHAMBRE PARENTS via D8
- HALL connects to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 via D10
- HALL connects to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2 via D9

Navigation Plan:
To reach CHAMBRE ENFANT 2 from the HALL, we only need to use one door, D9. Here's the efficient path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"}
  ]
}
```
