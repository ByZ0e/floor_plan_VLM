Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing out the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide the navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
- SEJOUR: Connected to CUISINE via D1 and D3, to CH.1 via D4
- CUISINE: Connected to SEJOUR via D1 and D3, to CELLIER via D2
- CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE via D2
- CH.1: Connected to SEJOUR via D4, to DEGT via D5
- DEGT: Connected to CH.1 via D5, to CH.2 via D6, to BAINS via D7, to WC via D8
- CH.2: Connected to DEGT via D6
- BAINS: Connected to DEGT via D7
- WC: Connected to DEGT via D8

Now, for the navigation plan from SEJOUR to CH.1:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
  ]
}
```

This plan is the most efficient route from SEJOUR to CH.1, using only the necessary door (D4) that directly connects these two rooms. No other doors or rooms need to be traversed for this particular navigation task.
