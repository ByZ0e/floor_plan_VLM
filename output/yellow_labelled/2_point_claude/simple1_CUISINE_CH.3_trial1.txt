Thank you for providing the floor plan. Let me start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections:

Rooms:
- CUISINE
- SEJOUR (multiple areas labeled as SEJOUR)
- CH.1
- CH.2
- CH.3

Doors:
- D1: Connects CH.3 to SEJOUR
- D2: Connects CH.3 to CH.2
- D3: Connects CH.2 to SEJOUR
- D4: Connects CH.1 to SEJOUR
- D5: Connects CUISINE to SEJOUR
- D6: Connects CUISINE to SEJOUR (another entrance)

Now, let's plan the navigation from CUISINE to CH.3:

1. Start in CUISINE
2. Use D5 to enter SEJOUR
3. Cross SEJOUR to reach D1
4. Use D1 to enter CH.3

Here's the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from the CUISINE to CH.3, using only the necessary doors (D5 and D1) and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
