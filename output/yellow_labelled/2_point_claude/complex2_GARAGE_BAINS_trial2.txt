Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing out the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide you with the navigation plan to get from the GARAGE to the BAINS.

Rooms and Doors:
- GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER via D9
- CELLIER: Connected to GARAGE via D9, to HALL via D1
- CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL via D2
- HALL: Connected to multiple rooms (central area)
- BAINS: Connected to HALL via D3
- WC: Connected to HALL via D4
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D6
- PORCHE: Connected to HALL via D5
- CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D7, to TERRASSE COUVERTE via D8

Navigation Plan:
To get from the GARAGE to the BAINS, here's the efficient path:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"}
  ]
}
```

This path takes you from the GARAGE, through the CELLIER, into the HALL, and finally into the BAINS. It uses only the necessary doors (D9, D1, and D3) and avoids any unnecessary detours or rooms.
