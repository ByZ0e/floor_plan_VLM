I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
- CH. PARENTS: Connected to CUISINE via D3
- CUISINE: Connected to CH. PARENTS via D3, to DOUCHE via D4, to CELLIER via D2, and to TERRASSE COUVERTE via D1
- DOUCHE: Connected to CUISINE via D4
- CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE via D2
- TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE via D1

Now, for the navigation plan from CH. PARENTS to CUISINE to DOUCHE:

{
  "plan": [
    "ApproachDoor(D3)",
    "OpenDoor(D3)",
    "GoThrough(D3)",
    "ApproachDoor(D4)",
    "OpenDoor(D4)",
    "GoThrough(D4)"
  ]
}

This plan efficiently navigates from CH. PARENTS to CUISINE using D3, and then from CUISINE to DOUCHE using D4, following the most direct path without any unnecessary detours or room visits.
