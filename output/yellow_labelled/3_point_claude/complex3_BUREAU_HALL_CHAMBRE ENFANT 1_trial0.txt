Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan as requested.

Rooms and Doors:

- BUREAU: Connected to HALL via D6
- HALL: Central area connecting multiple rooms
- CHAMBRE ENFANT 1: Connected to HALL via D10
- D6: Connects BUREAU to HALL
- D10: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1

Now, for the navigation plan from BUREAU to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D10"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the BUREAU to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 using only the necessary doors. It starts in the BUREAU, goes through D6 to enter the HALL, and then through D10 to reach CHAMBRE ENFANT 1. The plan avoids any unnecessary doors or rooms, providing a direct path to the destination.
