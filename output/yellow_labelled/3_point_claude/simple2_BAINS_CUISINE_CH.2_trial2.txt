Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
- BAINS: Connected to HALL via D1
- CH.1: Connected to HALL via D2
- CH.2: Connected to HALL via D3
- GARAGE: Connected to CUISINE via D4
- CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D5

Now, for the navigation plan from BAINS to CUISINE to CH.2:

{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"}
  ]
}

This plan efficiently navigates from BAINS to CUISINE and then to CH.2 using only the necessary doors. It takes into account that doors close after each GoThrough action, so we need to reopen D5 when leaving CUISINE to enter the HALL again before reaching CH.2.
