Certainly! I'll provide you with a detailed navigation plan based on the floor plan image. First, let's list out the rooms and doors with their connections:

Rooms and Doors:
- CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D7
- PORCHE: Connected to HALL via D6
- BAINS: Connected to HALL via D2
- HALL: Central area connecting multiple rooms

Now, let's create the navigation plan:

1. Start in CUISINE
2. ApproachDoor(D7)
3. OpenDoor(D7)
4. GoThrough(D7)
5. ApproachDoor(D6)
6. OpenDoor(D6)
7. GoThrough(D6)
8. ApproachDoor(D6)
9. OpenDoor(D6)
10. GoThrough(D6)
11. ApproachDoor(D2)
12. OpenDoor(D2)
13. GoThrough(D2)

This plan takes you from CUISINE to PORCHE and then to BAINS, using only the necessary doors. Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"}
  ]
}
```

This path ensures you start in CUISINE, visit PORCHE, and end up in BAINS, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
