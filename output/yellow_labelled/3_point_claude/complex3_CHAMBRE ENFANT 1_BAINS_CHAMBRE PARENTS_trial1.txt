First, let me list out the rooms and doors with their connections:

Rooms and their connections:
1. CHAMBRE ENFANT 1: Connected to HALL via D10
2. HALL: Central area connecting multiple rooms
3. BAINS: Connected to HALL via D7
4. CHAMBRE PARENTS: Connected to HALL via D8
5. BUREAU: Connected to HALL via D6
6. LINGERIE: Connected to HALL via D5
7. WC: Connected to HALL via D4
8. CELLIER: Connected to HALL via D3, D2, D11
9. GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER via D1
10. CHAMBRE ENFANT 2: Connected to HALL via D9
11. PORCHE: Connected to CELLIER via D3

Doors:
D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9, D10, D11

Now, for the navigation plan from CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 to BAINS to CHAMBRE PARENTS:

{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(D10)",
    "OpenDoor(D10)",
    "GoThrough(D10)",
    "ApproachDoor(D7)",
    "OpenDoor(D7)",
    "GoThrough(D7)",
    "ApproachDoor(D7)",
    "OpenDoor(D7)",
    "GoThrough(D7)",
    "ApproachDoor(D8)",
    "OpenDoor(D8)",
    "GoThrough(D8)"
  ]
}

This path efficiently navigates from CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 to BAINS and then to CHAMBRE PARENTS using only the necessary doors. The plan accounts for doors closing after each GoThrough action, so we open and go through D7 twice to exit and re-enter the HALL area.
