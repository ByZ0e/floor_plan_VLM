First, let me describe the rooms and doors based on the floor plan:

Rooms:
- CUISINE
- SEJOUR (multiple areas labeled as SEJOUR)
- CH.1
- CH.2
- CH.3

Doors:
- D1: Connects CH.3 to SEJOUR
- D2: Connects CH.3 to CH.2
- D3: Connects CH.2 to SEJOUR
- D4: Connects CH.1 to SEJOUR
- D5: Connects CUISINE to SEJOUR
- D6: Connects CUISINE to SEJOUR (another entrance)

Now, for the navigation plan from CUISINE to SEJOUR to CH.2:

1. Start in CUISINE
2. Use D5 to enter SEJOUR
3. From SEJOUR, use D3 to enter CH.2

Here's the detailed plan in the requested format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(D5)",
    "OpenDoor(D5)",
    "GoThrough(D5)",
    "ApproachDoor(D3)",
    "OpenDoor(D3)",
    "GoThrough(D3)"
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CUISINE to SEJOUR and then to CH.2 using the minimum number of necessary doors. It avoids any unnecessary rooms or doors, and follows the correct sequence of actions for each door traversal.
