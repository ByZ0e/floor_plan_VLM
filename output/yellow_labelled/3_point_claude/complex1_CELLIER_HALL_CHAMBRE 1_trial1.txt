I'll start by listing out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan.

Rooms and Doors:
- CELLIER: Connected to HALL via D1
- HALL: Central area connecting multiple rooms
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D4
- D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
- D4: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1

Now, for the navigation plan from CELLIER to CHAMBRE 1:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the CELLIER to CHAMBRE 1 using only the necessary doors. It starts in the CELLIER, goes through D1 to enter the HALL, and then through D4 to reach CHAMBRE 1. No unnecessary rooms or doors are included in this path.
