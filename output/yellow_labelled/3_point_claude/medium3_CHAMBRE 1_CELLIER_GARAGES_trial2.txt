Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
- CHAMBRE 1 connects to HALL via D5
- HALL connects to WC via D4
- HALL connects to DOUCHE via D2
- HALL connects to CUISINE via D6
- CUISINE connects to CELLIER via D3
- CELLIER connects to GARAGES via D1

Now, for the navigation plan from CHAMBRE 1 to CELLIER to GARAGES:

{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(D5)",
    "OpenDoor(D5)",
    "GoThrough(D5)",
    "ApproachDoor(D6)",
    "OpenDoor(D6)",
    "GoThrough(D6)",
    "ApproachDoor(D3)",
    "OpenDoor(D3)",
    "GoThrough(D3)",
    "ApproachDoor(D1)",
    "OpenDoor(D1)",
    "GoThrough(D1)"
  ]
}

This plan efficiently navigates from CHAMBRE 1 to CELLIER and then to GARAGES using only the necessary doors along the path. It avoids any unnecessary rooms or doors and ensures that each door is opened before going through it.
