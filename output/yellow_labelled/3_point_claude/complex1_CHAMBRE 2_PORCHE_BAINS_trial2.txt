Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors, and then provide a navigation plan as requested.

Rooms and Doors:
- CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL via D5
- PORCHE: Connected to HALL via D6
- BAINS: Connected to HALL via D2
- HALL: Central area connecting multiple rooms
- CELLIER: Connected to HALL via D1
- GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER via D9
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D4
- WC: Connected to HALL via D3
- CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D7
- TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE via D8

Navigation Plan:
To go from CHAMBRE 2 to PORCHE, then to BAINS, here's the efficient path:

```json
{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(D5)",
    "OpenDoor(D5)",
    "GoThrough(D5)",
    "ApproachDoor(D6)",
    "OpenDoor(D6)",
    "GoThrough(D6)",
    "ApproachDoor(D6)",
    "OpenDoor(D6)",
    "GoThrough(D6)",
    "ApproachDoor(D2)",
    "OpenDoor(D2)",
    "GoThrough(D2)"
  ]
}
```

This path takes you from CHAMBRE 2 through the HALL to PORCHE, then back through the HALL to BAINS, using only the necessary doors along the way.
