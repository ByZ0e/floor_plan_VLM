Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout and provide you with a detailed navigation plan as requested. First, let me list out the rooms and doors with their connections:

Rooms and their connections:
- TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE via D1
- CUISINE: Connected to TERRASSE COUVERTE via D1, to CELLIER via D2, and to CH. PARENTS via D3
- CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE via D2
- CH. PARENTS: Connected to CUISINE via D3, and to DOUCHE via D4
- DOUCHE: Connected to CH. PARENTS via D4

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan to go from TERRASSE COUVERTE to CH. PARENTS, and then to CUISINE:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to CH. PARENTS, and then back to CUISINE, using only the necessary doors along the path.
