Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors, and then provide the navigation plan as requested.

Rooms and Doors:
- BAINS: connected to HALL via D4
- WC: connected to HALL via D3
- CHAMBRE 1: connected to HALL via D2
- CHAMBRE 2: connected to HALL via D6
- CHAMBRE 3: connected to HALL via D5
- GARAGE: connected to CELLIER via D1
- CELLIER: connected to HALL via D7
- Porche: connected to HALL via D8

Navigation Plan:
To go from BAINS to CHAMBRE 2 and then to WC, we need to use the HALL as the connecting area. Here's the efficient navigation plan:

{
  "plan": [
    "ApproachDoor(D4)",
    "OpenDoor(D4)",
    "GoThrough(D4)",
    "ApproachDoor(D6)",
    "OpenDoor(D6)",
    "GoThrough(D6)",
    "ApproachDoor(D6)",
    "OpenDoor(D6)",
    "GoThrough(D6)",
    "ApproachDoor(D3)",
    "OpenDoor(D3)",
    "GoThrough(D3)"
  ]
}

This plan efficiently navigates from BAINS to CHAMBRE 2 and then to WC using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
