First, let me describe the rooms and doors based on the floor plan:

Rooms:
- CUISINE
- SEJOUR (multiple areas labeled as SEJOUR)
- CH.1
- CH.2
- CH.3

Doors:
- D1: Connects CH.3 to SEJOUR
- D2: Connects CH.3 to CH.2
- D3: Connects CH.2 to SEJOUR
- D4: Connects CH.1 to SEJOUR
- D5: Connects CUISINE to SEJOUR
- D6: Connects CUISINE to SEJOUR

Now, for the navigation plan from CUISINE to CH.3, then to SEJOUR:

1. Start in CUISINE
2. Use D5 to enter SEJOUR
3. Use D1 to enter CH.3
4. Use D1 again to return to SEJOUR

Here's the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D5"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D5"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D5"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D1"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CUISINE to CH.3 and then to SEJOUR using the minimum number of necessary doors.
