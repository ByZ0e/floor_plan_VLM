Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan as requested.

Rooms and Doors:
- TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE via D1
- CUISINE (main area): Connected to TERRASSE COUVERTE via D1, to upper CUISINE via D2, to CH. PARENTS via D3
- Upper CUISINE (with CELLIER): Connected to main CUISINE via D2
- CH. PARENTS: Connected to CUISINE via D3, to DOUCHE via D4
- DOUCHE: Connected to CH. PARENTS via D4

Now, for the navigation plan from TERRASSE COUVERTE to CH. PARENTS, then to CUISINE:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to CH. PARENTS and then back to the main CUISINE area, using only the necessary doors (D1 and D3) without any unnecessary detours or room visits.
