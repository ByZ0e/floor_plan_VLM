Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors, and then provide a navigation plan for your robot to move from CH.2 to GARAGE via HALL.

Rooms and Doors:
- CH.1: Connected to HALL via D2
- CH.2: Connected to HALL via D3
- BAINS: Connected to HALL via D1
- GARAGE: Connected to CUISINE via D4
- CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D5
- HALL: Central area connecting all rooms

Navigation Plan:
To move from CH.2 to GARAGE via HALL, the robot needs to use two doors: D3 and D4. Here's the detailed plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate the robot from CH.2 to HALL (using D3), and then from HALL to GARAGE (using D4), following the specified path and using only the necessary doors.
