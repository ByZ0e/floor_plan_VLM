Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
- CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D7
- HALL: Central area connecting multiple rooms
- CELLIER: Connected to HALL via D1
- GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER via D9
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D4
- CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL via D5
- BAINS: Connected to HALL via D2
- WC: Connected to HALL via D3
- PORCHE: Connected to HALL via D6
- TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE via D8

Now, for the navigation plan from CUISINE to CELLIER to GARAGE:

```json
{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(D7)",
    "OpenDoor(D7)",
    "GoThrough(D7)",
    "ApproachDoor(D1)",
    "OpenDoor(D1)",
    "GoThrough(D1)",
    "ApproachDoor(D9)",
    "OpenDoor(D9)",
    "GoThrough(D9)"
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the CUISINE to the CELLIER and finally to the GARAGE using the necessary doors. The path avoids any unnecessary rooms or doors, ensuring a direct route to your destination.
