To begin, let me outline the rooms and doors with their connections based on the floor plan:

Rooms and their connections:
- BAINS: Connected to HALL via D1
- CH.1: Connected to HALL via D2
- CH.2: Connected to HALL via D3
- GARAGE: Connected to CUISINE via D4
- CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D5

Doors and the rooms they connect:
D1: BAINS <-> HALL
D2: CH.1 <-> HALL
D3: CH.2 <-> HALL
D4: GARAGE <-> CUISINE
D5: CUISINE <-> HALL

Now, let's create the navigation plan from BAINS to CUISINE to GARAGE:

{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(D1)",
    "OpenDoor(D1)",
    "GoThrough(D1)",
    "ApproachDoor(D5)",
    "OpenDoor(D5)",
    "GoThrough(D5)",
    "ApproachDoor(D4)",
    "OpenDoor(D4)",
    "GoThrough(D4)"
  ]
}

This plan efficiently navigates from BAINS to CUISINE to GARAGE using the necessary doors without any unnecessary detours or room entries.
