Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout and provide a navigation plan as requested. First, let me describe the rooms and doors for reference:

Rooms:
- TERRASSE COUVERTE
- CUISINE (appears to be a large open area)
- CELLIER
- CH. PARENTS
- DOUCHE

Doors:
- D1: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE to CUISINE
- D2: Connects CUISINE to CELLIER
- D3: Connects CUISINE to CH. PARENTS
- D4: Connects CH. PARENTS to DOUCHE

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan to go from TERRASSE COUVERTE to CH. PARENTS and then to DOUCHE:

{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "target": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "target": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "target": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "target": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "target": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "target": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "target": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "target": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "target": "D4"}
  ]
}

This plan efficiently navigates you from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to the DOUCHE, passing through CH. PARENTS as required, using only the necessary doors along the path.
