Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing out the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide the navigation plan as requested.

Rooms and Doors:
- CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL via D2
- HALL: Central area connecting multiple rooms
- WC: Connected to HALL via D4
- GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER via D9
- CELLIER: Connected to HALL via D1

Navigation Plan:
To go from CHAMBRE 2 to WC, and then to GARAGE, we need to use the following doors: D2, D4, D1, and D9.

Here's the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently guide you from CHAMBRE 2 to WC, and then to GARAGE, using only the necessary doors along the path.
