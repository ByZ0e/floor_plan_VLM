Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
- CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL via D2
- GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER via D9
- CELLIER: Connected to GARAGE via D9, connected to HALL via D1
- HALL: Central area connecting multiple rooms

Navigation Plan:
To go from CHAMBRE 2 to GARAGE, then to CELLIER, we need to use the following sequence of actions:

```json
[
  {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
  {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
  {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
  {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
  {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
  {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
  {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
  {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
  {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"},
  {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
  {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
  {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"}
]
```

This plan efficiently navigates you from CHAMBRE 2 to GARAGE and then to CELLIER using the necessary doors. It avoids any unnecessary rooms or doors and ensures you reach your destination as requested.
