First, let me describe the rooms and doors as shown in the floor plan:

Rooms and their connections:
- GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER via D9
- CELLIER: Connected to GARAGE via D9, and to HALL via D1
- HALL: Central area connecting multiple rooms
- BAINS: Connected to HALL
- WC: Connected to HALL via D2
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D4
- CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL via D5
- CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D7
- PORCHE: Connected to HALL via D6
- TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE via D8

Doors:
D1: Between CELLIER and HALL
D2: Between WC and HALL
D3: Between WC and HALL (appears to be an additional door)
D4: Between CHAMBRE 1 and HALL
D5: Between CHAMBRE 2 and HALL
D6: Between PORCHE and HALL
D7: Between CUISINE and HALL
D8: Between CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Between GARAGE and CELLIER

Now, for the navigation plan from GARAGE to CHAMBRE 1, then to CHAMBRE 2:

{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(D9)",
    "OpenDoor(D9)",
    "GoThrough(D9)",
    "ApproachDoor(D1)",
    "OpenDoor(D1)",
    "GoThrough(D1)",
    "ApproachDoor(D4)",
    "OpenDoor(D4)",
    "GoThrough(D4)",
    "ApproachDoor(D4)",
    "OpenDoor(D4)",
    "GoThrough(D4)",
    "ApproachDoor(D5)",
    "OpenDoor(D5)",
    "GoThrough(D5)"
  ]
}

This path efficiently navigates from the GARAGE to CHAMBRE 1, and then to CHAMBRE 2, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
