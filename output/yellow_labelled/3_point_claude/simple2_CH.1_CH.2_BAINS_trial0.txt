Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout and provide you with a detailed navigation plan as requested. First, let me list out the rooms and doors with their connections:

Rooms and their connections:
- CH.1: Connected to HALL via D2
- CH.2: Connected to HALL via D3
- BAINS: Connected to HALL via D1
- GARAGE: Connected to CUISINE via D4
- CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D5
- HALL: Central area connecting all rooms

Doors:
- D1: Connects BAINS and HALL
- D2: Connects CH.1 and HALL
- D3: Connects CH.2 and HALL
- D4: Connects GARAGE and CUISINE
- D5: Connects CUISINE and HALL

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan to go from CH.1 to CH.2 and then to BAINS:

```json
{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(D2)",
    "OpenDoor(D2)",
    "GoThrough(D2)",
    "ApproachDoor(D3)",
    "OpenDoor(D3)",
    "GoThrough(D3)",
    "ApproachDoor(D3)",
    "OpenDoor(D3)",
    "GoThrough(D3)",
    "ApproachDoor(D1)",
    "OpenDoor(D1)",
    "GoThrough(D1)"
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently guide you from CH.1 to CH.2 and finally to BAINS, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
