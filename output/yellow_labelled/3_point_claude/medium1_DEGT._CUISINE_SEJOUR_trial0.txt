Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan as requested.

Rooms and Doors:

DEGT: Connected to CH.1, CH.2, SEJOUR via D4, D5, D6
CUISINE: Connected to SEJOUR via D3
SEJOUR: Connected to DEGT via D4, to CUISINE via D3, and to another part of SEJOUR via D1
CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE via D2
CH.1: Connected to DEGT via D5
CH.2: Connected to DEGT via D6
BAINS: Connected to DEGT via D7
WC: Connected to DEGT via D8

Now, for the navigation plan from DEGT to CUISINE to SEJOUR:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from DEGT to CUISINE and then to SEJOUR using the minimum necessary actions and doors. The robot starts in DEGT, goes through D3 to enter CUISINE, and then goes back through D3 to enter SEJOUR. No unnecessary doors or rooms are included in this path.
