Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first describe the rooms and doors, then provide the navigation plan as requested.

Rooms and Doors:
- CH.1: Connected to HALL through D2
- CH.2: Connected to HALL through D3
- BAINS: Connected to HALL through D1
- GARAGE: Connected to CUISINE through D4
- CUISINE: Connected to HALL through D5
- HALL: Central area connecting all rooms

Now, for the navigation plan from CH.1 to CH.2 and finally to BAINS:

```json
{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(D2)",
    "OpenDoor(D2)",
    "GoThrough(D2)",
    "ApproachDoor(D3)",
    "OpenDoor(D3)",
    "GoThrough(D3)",
    "ApproachDoor(D1)",
    "OpenDoor(D1)",
    "GoThrough(D1)"
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CH.1 to CH.2 and then to BAINS using only the necessary doors. It avoids any unnecessary rooms or doors, providing a direct path as requested.
