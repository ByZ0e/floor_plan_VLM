Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D6
- HALL: Central area connecting multiple rooms
- CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D7
- TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE via D8
- WC: Connected to HALL via D4
- BAINS: Connected to HALL via D3
- CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL via D2
- PORCHE: Connected to HALL via D5
- CELLIER: Connected to GARAGE via D9, and to HALL via D1
- GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER via D9

Navigation Plan:
To go from CHAMBRE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE, and then to HALL, we need to follow this path:
CHAMBRE 1 -> HALL -> CUISINE -> TERRASSE COUVERTE -> CUISINE -> HALL

Here's the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates you from CHAMBRE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE and then to HALL, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
