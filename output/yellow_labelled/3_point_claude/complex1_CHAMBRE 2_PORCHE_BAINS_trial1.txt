Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the connections and provide a navigation plan as requested. First, let's list out the rooms and doors for reference:

Rooms and their connections:
- CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL via D5
- HALL: Central area connecting multiple rooms
- PORCHE: Connected to HALL via D6
- BAINS: Connected to HALL via D2
- CELLIER: Connected to HALL via D1
- GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER via D9
- WC: Connected to HALL via D3
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D4
- CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D7
- TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE via D8

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan to go from CHAMBRE 2 to PORCHE, and then to BAINS:

{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(D5)",
    "OpenDoor(D5)",
    "GoThrough(D5)",
    "ApproachDoor(D6)",
    "OpenDoor(D6)",
    "GoThrough(D6)",
    "ApproachDoor(D6)",
    "OpenDoor(D6)",
    "GoThrough(D6)",
    "ApproachDoor(D2)",
    "OpenDoor(D2)",
    "GoThrough(D2)"
  ]
}

This plan efficiently navigates you from CHAMBRE 2 to PORCHE and then to BAINS, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors. The plan takes into account that doors close after each GoThrough action, so you need to reopen D6 when returning to the HALL from PORCHE.
