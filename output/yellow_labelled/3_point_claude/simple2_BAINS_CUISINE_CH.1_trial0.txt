Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the connections and provide a navigation plan as requested. First, let's list out the rooms and doors with their connections:

Rooms and their connections:
- BAINS: Connected to HALL via D1
- CH.1: Connected to HALL via D2
- CH.2: Connected to HALL via D3
- GARAGE: Connected to CUISINE via D4
- CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D5

Doors and the rooms they connect:
D1: BAINS <-> HALL
D2: CH.1 <-> HALL
D3: CH.2 <-> HALL
D4: GARAGE <-> CUISINE
D5: CUISINE <-> HALL

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan to go from BAINS to CUISINE, and then to CH.1:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "target": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "target": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "target": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "target": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "target": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "target": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "target": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "target": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "target": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "target": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "target": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "target": "D2"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from BAINS to CUISINE and then to CH.1 using only the necessary doors. It avoids any unnecessary rooms or doors and provides the correct path based on the floor plan provided.
