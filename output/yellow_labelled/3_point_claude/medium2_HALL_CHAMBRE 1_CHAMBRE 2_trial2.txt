Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan as requested.

Rooms and Doors:
- HALL: Connected to CHAMBRE 1 via D2, CHAMBRE 2 via D6, CHAMBRE 3 via D5, BAINS via D4, CELLIER via D7, and Porche via D8
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D2, GARAGE via D1
- CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL via D6
- CHAMBRE 3: Connected to HALL via D5
- BAINS: Connected to HALL via D4
- GARAGE: Connected to CHAMBRE 1 via D1
- CELLIER: Connected to HALL via D7
- Porche: Connected to HALL via D8

Navigation Plan:
The plan to go from HALL to CHAMBRE 1 and then to CHAMBRE 2 is as follows:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the HALL to CHAMBRE 1, then back to the HALL, and finally to CHAMBRE 2, using only the necessary doors along the path.
