Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout and provide you with the requested navigation plan. First, let me list out the rooms and doors with their connections:

Rooms and their connections:
- CH.1: Connected to SEJOUR via D5
- SEJOUR: Connected to CH.1 via D5, to CUISINE via D3, to DEGT via D4
- CUISINE: Connected to SEJOUR via D3, to CELLIER via D2
- CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE via D2
- DEGT: Connected to SEJOUR via D4, to CH.2 via D6, to BAINS via D7
- CH.2: Connected to DEGT via D6
- BAINS: Connected to DEGT via D7

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan from CH.1 to CELLIER, and then to BAINS:

{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(D5)",
    "OpenDoor(D5)",
    "GoThrough(D5)",
    "ApproachDoor(D4)",
    "OpenDoor(D4)",
    "GoThrough(D4)",
    "ApproachDoor(D3)",
    "OpenDoor(D3)",
    "GoThrough(D3)",
    "ApproachDoor(D2)",
    "OpenDoor(D2)",
    "GoThrough(D2)",
    "ApproachDoor(D2)",
    "OpenDoor(D2)",
    "GoThrough(D2)",
    "ApproachDoor(D3)",
    "OpenDoor(D3)",
    "GoThrough(D3)",
    "ApproachDoor(D4)",
    "OpenDoor(D4)",
    "GoThrough(D4)",
    "ApproachDoor(D7)",
    "OpenDoor(D7)",
    "GoThrough(D7)"
  ]
}

This path will efficiently navigate you from CH.1 to CELLIER and then to BAINS, using only the necessary doors along the way.
