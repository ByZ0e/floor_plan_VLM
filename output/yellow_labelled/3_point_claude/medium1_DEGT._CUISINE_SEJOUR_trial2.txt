Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
- DEGT: Connected to SEJOUR via D4, to CH.2 via D6, and to hallway (near BAINS) via D7
- CUISINE: Connected to SEJOUR via D3
- SEJOUR: Connected to DEGT via D4, to CUISINE via D3, and to another part of SEJOUR via D1
- CH.1: Connected to SEJOUR via D5
- CH.2: Connected to DEGT via D6
- CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE via D2
- BAINS & WC: Connected to hallway near DEGT via D8
- Porche: Connected to SEJOUR via D1

Now, for the navigation plan from DEGT to CUISINE to SEJOUR:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from DEGT to CUISINE and then to SEJOUR using the minimum number of necessary actions and doors. The robot starts in DEGT, goes through D3 to enter CUISINE, and then goes back through D3 to reach SEJOUR. No unnecessary doors or rooms are included in this path.
