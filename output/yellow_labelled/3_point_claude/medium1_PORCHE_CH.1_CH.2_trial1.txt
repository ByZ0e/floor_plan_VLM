Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors, and then provide a navigation plan for your task.

Rooms and Doors:
- Porche: Connected to Sejour via D1
- Sejour: Connected to Porche via D1, Cuisine via D2 and D3, Degt via D4
- Cuisine: Connected to Sejour via D2 and D3, Cellier via D2
- Cellier: Connected to Cuisine via D2
- Degt: Connected to Sejour via D4, CH.1 via D5, CH.2 via D6, Bains via D7
- CH.1: Connected to Degt via D5
- CH.2: Connected to Degt via D6
- Bains: Connected to Degt via D7, WC via D8
- WC: Connected to Bains via D8

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan to go from Porche to CH.1, then to CH.2:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates you from the Porche to CH.1 and then to CH.2, using only the necessary doors along the path.
