Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the HALL to CELLIER and finally to GARAGE.

Rooms and Doors:
- HALL: Connected to CHAMBRE 1 (D2), CHAMBRE 2 (D6), CHAMBRE 3 (D5), BAINS (D4), CELLIER (D7), and Porche (D8)
- CELLIER: Connected to HALL (D7) and GARAGE (D1)
- GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER (D1)
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL (D2)
- CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL (D6)
- CHAMBRE 3: Connected to HALL (D5)
- BAINS: Connected to HALL (D4)
- Porche: Connected to HALL (D8)

Navigation Plan:
To go from HALL to CELLIER to GARAGE, we need to use doors D7 and D1. Here's the efficient navigation plan:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the HALL to CELLIER and then to GARAGE using the necessary doors D7 and D1. The plan avoids any unnecessary rooms or doors, ensuring a direct path to your destination.
