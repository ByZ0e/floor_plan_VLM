To begin, let me outline the rooms and doors with their connections based on the floor plan:

Rooms:
- CHAMBRE 1
- CHAMBRE 2
- CHAMBRE 3
- BAINS
- GARAGE
- CELLIER (3 separate areas)
- HALL (multiple areas)
- Porche

Doors:
D1: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER
D2: Connects CHAMBRE 1 and HALL
D3: Connects HALL and WC/BAINS area
D4: Connects BAINS and HALL
D5: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 3
D6: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 2
D7: Connects CELLIER and HALL
D8: Connects HALL and Porche

Now, for the navigation plan from CHAMBRE 1 to BAINS to GARAGE:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"}
  ]
}
```

This path efficiently navigates from CHAMBRE 1 to BAINS and then to GARAGE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
