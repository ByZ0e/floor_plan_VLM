First, let me describe the rooms and doors as shown in the floor plan:

Rooms:
- CUISINE
- SEJOUR (multiple areas labeled as SEJOUR)
- CH.1
- CH.2
- CH.3

Doors:
- D1: Connects CH.3 to SEJOUR
- D2: Connects CH.3 to CH.2
- D3: Connects CH.2 to SEJOUR
- D4: Connects CH.1 to SEJOUR
- D5: Connects CUISINE to SEJOUR
- D6: Connects CUISINE to SEJOUR

Now, for the navigation plan from CUISINE to CH.2, then to CH.1:

1. Start in CUISINE
2. Use D5 to enter SEJOUR
3. Use D3 to enter CH.2
4. Exit CH.2 through D3 back to SEJOUR
5. Use D4 to enter CH.1

Here's the efficient navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D5"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D5"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D5"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D3"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D3"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D3"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D3"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D3"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D3"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D4"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CUISINE to CH.2 and then to CH.1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
