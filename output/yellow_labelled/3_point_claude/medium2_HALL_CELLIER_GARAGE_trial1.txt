Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout and provide you with the navigation plan as requested. First, let me list out the rooms and doors with their connections:

Rooms and Doors:
- HALL: Connected to CHAMBRE 1 (D2), CHAMBRE 2 (D6), CHAMBRE 3 (D5), BAINS (D4), CELLIER (D7), and Porche (D8)
- CELLIER: Connected to HALL (D7) and GARAGE (D1)
- GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER (D1)
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL (D2)
- CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL (D6)
- CHAMBRE 3: Connected to HALL (D5)
- BAINS: Connected to HALL (D4)
- Porche: Connected to HALL (D8)

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan to go from HALL to CELLIER to GARAGE:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates you from the HALL to the CELLIER and then to the GARAGE using the necessary doors. It avoids any unnecessary rooms or doors, providing a direct path to your destination.
