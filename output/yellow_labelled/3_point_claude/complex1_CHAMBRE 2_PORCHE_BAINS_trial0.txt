Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan as requested.

Rooms and Doors:
- CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL via D5
- HALL: Central area connecting multiple rooms
- PORCHE: Connected to HALL via D6
- BAINS: Connected to HALL via D2
- CELLIER: Connected to HALL via D1
- GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER via D9
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D3 and D4
- CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D7
- TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE via D8
- WC: Connected to HALL (shares door D2 with BAINS)

Now, for the navigation plan from CHAMBRE 2 to PORCHE to BAINS:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CHAMBRE 2 to PORCHE and then to BAINS, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
