Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan as requested.

Rooms and Door Connections:
- BUREAU: Connected to HALL via D6
- HALL: Central area connecting multiple rooms
- CHAMBRE ENFANT 1: Connected to HALL via D10

Navigation Plan:
To go from BUREAU to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1, we need to pass through the HALL. Here's the detailed plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D10"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates you from the BUREAU to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 using only the necessary doors. You'll start in the BUREAU, go through D6 to enter the HALL, and then use D10 to reach CHAMBRE ENFANT 1. This is the most direct route based on the floor plan provided.
