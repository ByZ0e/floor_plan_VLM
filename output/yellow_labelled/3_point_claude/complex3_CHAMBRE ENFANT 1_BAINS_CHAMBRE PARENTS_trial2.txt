First, let me describe the rooms and doors for reference:

Rooms:
- CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
- CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
- HALL (multiple sections)
- CHAMBRE PARENTS
- BAINS
- BUREAU
- LINGERIE
- WC
- CELLIER (multiple)
- GARAGE
- PORCHE

Doors:
D1: Between GARAGE and CELLIER
D2: Between CELLIER and PORCHE
D3: Between PORCHE and HALL
D4: Between HALL and WC
D5: Between HALL and LINGERIE
D6: Between LINGERIE and BUREAU
D7: Between BUREAU and BAINS
D8: Between BAINS and CHAMBRE PARENTS
D9: Between HALL and CHAMBRE PARENTS
D10: Between HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
D11: Between HALL and CELLIER

Now, for the navigation plan from CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 to BAINS to CHAMBRE PARENTS:

{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(D10)",
    "OpenDoor(D10)",
    "GoThrough(D10)",
    "ApproachDoor(D6)",
    "OpenDoor(D6)",
    "GoThrough(D6)",
    "ApproachDoor(D7)",
    "OpenDoor(D7)",
    "GoThrough(D7)",
    "ApproachDoor(D8)",
    "OpenDoor(D8)",
    "GoThrough(D8)"
  ]
}

This path takes you from CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 through the HALL, then through BUREAU to reach BAINS, and finally to CHAMBRE PARENTS. It's the most efficient route given the layout and the requirement to visit BAINS before reaching CHAMBRE PARENTS.
