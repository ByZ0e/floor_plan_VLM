Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan as requested.

Rooms and Doors:
- BAINS: Connected to HALL via D7
- CHAMBRE PARENTS: Connected to HALL via D8
- BUREAU: Connected to HALL via D6
- LINGERIE: Connected to HALL via D5
- WC: Connected to HALL via D4
- CELLIER: Connected to HALL via D3, to GARAGE via D1, and to PORCHE via D2
- GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER via D1
- CHAMBRE ENFANT 1: Connected to HALL via D10
- CHAMBRE ENFANT 2: Connected to HALL via D9
- HALL: Central area connecting most rooms

Navigation Plan:
To go from BAINS to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2, then to GARAGE, here's the efficient path:

{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(D7)",
    "OpenDoor(D7)",
    "GoThrough(D7)",
    "ApproachDoor(D9)",
    "OpenDoor(D9)",
    "GoThrough(D9)",
    "ApproachDoor(D9)",
    "OpenDoor(D9)",
    "GoThrough(D9)",
    "ApproachDoor(D11)",
    "OpenDoor(D11)",
    "GoThrough(D11)",
    "ApproachDoor(D1)",
    "OpenDoor(D1)",
    "GoThrough(D1)"
  ]
}

This plan efficiently navigates from BAINS to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2 and then to GARAGE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
