Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan as requested.

Rooms and Doors:
- CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE via D2
- CUISINE: Large central area, connected to CELLIER (D2), TERRASSE COUVERTE (D1), and CH. PARENTS (D3)
- TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE via D1
- CH. PARENTS: Connected to CUISINE via D3, and to DOUCHE via D4
- DOUCHE: Connected to CH. PARENTS via D4

Now, for the navigation plan from CELLIER to DOUCHE to TERRASSE COUVERTE:

```json
{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(D2)",
    "OpenDoor(D2)",
    "GoThrough(D2)",
    "ApproachDoor(D3)",
    "OpenDoor(D3)",
    "GoThrough(D3)",
    "ApproachDoor(D4)",
    "OpenDoor(D4)",
    "GoThrough(D4)",
    "ApproachDoor(D4)",
    "OpenDoor(D4)",
    "GoThrough(D4)",
    "ApproachDoor(D3)",
    "OpenDoor(D3)",
    "GoThrough(D3)",
    "ApproachDoor(D1)",
    "OpenDoor(D1)",
    "GoThrough(D1)"
  ]
}
```

This path takes you from the CELLIER through the CUISINE, then to CH. PARENTS and DOUCHE, back through CH. PARENTS and CUISINE, and finally to the TERRASSE COUVERTE. It uses only the necessary doors and follows the most direct route given the layout of the floor plan.
