Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
- DOUCHE: Connected to HALL via D2
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D5
- HALL: Central area connecting multiple rooms
- CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D6 and D7
- CELLIER: Connected to GARAGES via D1, and to HALL via D3
- WC: Connected to HALL via D4
- GARAGES: Large area with access to CELLIER via D1

Now, for the navigation plan from DOUCHE to CHAMBRE 1, then to HALL:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates you from the DOUCHE to CHAMBRE 1 and then back to the HALL, using only the necessary doors along the path. The plan avoids any unnecessary rooms or doors, and ensures that you end up in the HALL as requested.
