To begin, I'll list out the rooms and doors with their connections based on the floor plan:

Rooms and their connections:
- BUREAU: Connected to HALL via D6
- HALL: Central area connecting multiple rooms
- CHAMBRE ENFANT 1: Connected to HALL via D10

Doors and their connections:
D6: Connects BUREAU to HALL
D10: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1

Now, for the navigation plan from BUREAU to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1:

1. Start in BUREAU
2. Use D6 to enter HALL
3. Move through HALL
4. Use D10 to enter CHAMBRE ENFANT 1

Here's the detailed navigation plan in the requested format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(D6)",
    "OpenDoor(D6)",
    "GoThrough(D6)",
    "ApproachDoor(D10)",
    "OpenDoor(D10)",
    "GoThrough(D10)"
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient and direct route from the BUREAU to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1, using only the necessary doors (D6 and D10) and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
