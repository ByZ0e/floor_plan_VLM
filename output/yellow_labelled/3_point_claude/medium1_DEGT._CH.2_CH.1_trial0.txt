Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide the navigation plan.

Rooms and Doors:
- DEGT: Connected to CH.1 (D5), CH.2 (D6), SEJOUR (D4), and BAINS (D7)
- CH.1: Connected to DEGT (D5)
- CH.2: Connected to DEGT (D6)
- SEJOUR: Connected to DEGT (D4), CUISINE (D3), and Porche (D1)
- CUISINE: Connected to SEJOUR (D3) and CELLIER (D2)
- CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE (D2)
- BAINS: Connected to DEGT (D7) and WC (D8)
- WC: Connected to BAINS (D8)

Now, for the navigation plan from DEGT to CH.2 and then to CH.1:

```json
{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(D6)",
    "OpenDoor(D6)",
    "GoThrough(D6)",
    "ApproachDoor(D6)",
    "OpenDoor(D6)",
    "GoThrough(D6)",
    "ApproachDoor(D5)",
    "OpenDoor(D5)",
    "GoThrough(D5)"
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates you from DEGT to CH.2, then back to DEGT, and finally to CH.1, using only the necessary doors. The plan takes into account that doors close after each GoThrough action, so we need to reopen them when returning.
