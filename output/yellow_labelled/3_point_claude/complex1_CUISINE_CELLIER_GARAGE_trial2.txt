First, I'll list out the rooms and doors with their connections:

Rooms and their connections:
- CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D7, connected to TERRASSE COUVERTE via D8
- HALL: Central area connecting multiple rooms
- TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE via D8
- PORCHE: Connected to HALL via D6
- CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL via D5
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D4
- WC: Connected to HALL via D2
- BAINS: Connected to HALL via D3
- CELLIER: Connected to HALL via D1, connected to GARAGE via D9
- GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER via D9

Now, for the navigation plan from CUISINE to CELLIER to GARAGE:

{
  "plan": [
    "ApproachDoor(D7)",
    "OpenDoor(D7)",
    "GoThrough(D7)",
    "ApproachDoor(D1)",
    "OpenDoor(D1)",
    "GoThrough(D1)",
    "ApproachDoor(D9)",
    "OpenDoor(D9)",
    "GoThrough(D9)"
  ]
}

This plan efficiently navigates from the CUISINE to the CELLIER and then to the GARAGE using the necessary doors without any unnecessary detours or room visits.
