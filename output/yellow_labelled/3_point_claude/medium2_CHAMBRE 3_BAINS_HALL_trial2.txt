First, let me describe the rooms and doors as seen in the floor plan:

Rooms:
- GARAGE
- CHAMBRE 1
- CHAMBRE 2
- CHAMBRE 3
- BAINS
- CELLIER (3 small rooms)
- HALL (multiple sections)
- Porche

Doors:
D1: Between GARAGE and HALL
D2: Between CHAMBRE 1 and HALL
D3: Between WC and HALL
D4: Between BAINS and HALL
D5: Between CHAMBRE 3 and HALL
D6: Between CHAMBRE 2 and HALL
D7: Between CELLIER and HALL
D8: Between HALL and Porche

Now, for the navigation plan from CHAMBRE 3 to BAINS and then to HALL:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
  ]
}
```

This path efficiently navigates from CHAMBRE 3 to BAINS and then to HALL using only the necessary doors. The robot starts in CHAMBRE 3, goes through D5 to enter the HALL, then through D4 to enter BAINS, and finally back through D4 to end up in the HALL as requested.
