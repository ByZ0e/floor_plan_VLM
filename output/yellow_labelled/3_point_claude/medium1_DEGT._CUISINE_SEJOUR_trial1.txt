Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the connections and provide a navigation plan as requested. First, let's list out the rooms and doors with their connections:

Rooms and their connections:
- DEGT: Connected to CH.1, CH.2, SEJOUR, and BAINS via D4, D5, D6, D7
- CUISINE: Connected to SEJOUR via D3
- SEJOUR: Connected to DEGT via D4, CUISINE via D3, and Porche via D1
- CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE via D2
- CH.1: Connected to DEGT via D5
- CH.2: Connected to DEGT via D6
- BAINS: Connected to DEGT via D7
- WC: Connected to BAINS (no separate door)

Doors:
D1: Between SEJOUR and Porche
D2: Between CELLIER and CUISINE
D3: Between CUISINE and SEJOUR
D4: Between SEJOUR and DEGT
D5: Between DEGT and CH.1
D6: Between DEGT and CH.2
D7: Between DEGT and BAINS
D8: Between DEGT and WC

Now, for the navigation plan from DEGT to CUISINE to SEJOUR:

{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(D4)",
    "OpenDoor(D4)",
    "GoThrough(D4)",
    "ApproachDoor(D3)",
    "OpenDoor(D3)",
    "GoThrough(D3)",
    "ApproachDoor(D3)",
    "OpenDoor(D3)",
    "GoThrough(D3)"
  ]
}

This plan efficiently navigates from DEGT to CUISINE and then to SEJOUR using the minimum number of necessary doors. It avoids any unnecessary rooms or doors and provides the correct path based on the floor plan provided.
