Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout and provide you with a detailed navigation plan as requested. First, let me list out the rooms and doors with their connections:

Rooms and Connections:
- HALL: Connected to CHAMBRE 1, CHAMBRE 2, CHAMBRE 3, BAINS, CELLIER, and Porche
- CELLIER: Connected to HALL and GARAGE
- GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL
- CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL
- CHAMBRE 3: Connected to HALL
- BAINS: Connected to HALL
- Porche: Connected to HALL

Doors:
- D1: Between GARAGE and CELLIER
- D2: Between CHAMBRE 1 and HALL
- D3: Between BAINS and HALL
- D4: Between CHAMBRE 3 and HALL
- D5: Between CHAMBRE 3 and HALL
- D6: Between CHAMBRE 2 and HALL
- D7: Between CELLIER and HALL
- D8: Between HALL and Porche

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan to go from HALL to CELLIER to GARAGE:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the HALL to the CELLIER and then to the GARAGE using the necessary doors. The plan avoids any unnecessary rooms or doors, ensuring a direct path to your destination.
