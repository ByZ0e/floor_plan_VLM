Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout and provide you with a detailed navigation plan as requested. First, let me list out the rooms and doors with their connections:

Rooms and their connections:
- CH.1: Connected to SEJOUR via D5
- SEJOUR: Connected to CH.1 (D5), CUISINE (D3), DEGT (D4)
- CUISINE: Connected to SEJOUR (D3), CELLIER (D2)
- CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE (D2)
- DEGT: Connected to SEJOUR (D4), CH.2 (D6), BAINS (D7)
- CH.2: Connected to DEGT (D6)
- BAINS: Connected to DEGT (D7)

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan to go from CH.1 to CELLIER, and then to BAINS:

{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(D5)",
    "OpenDoor(D5)",
    "GoThrough(D5)",
    "ApproachDoor(D3)",
    "OpenDoor(D3)",
    "GoThrough(D3)",
    "ApproachDoor(D2)",
    "OpenDoor(D2)",
    "GoThrough(D2)",
    "ApproachDoor(D2)",
    "OpenDoor(D2)",
    "GoThrough(D2)",
    "ApproachDoor(D3)",
    "OpenDoor(D3)",
    "GoThrough(D3)",
    "ApproachDoor(D4)",
    "OpenDoor(D4)",
    "GoThrough(D4)",
    "ApproachDoor(D7)",
    "OpenDoor(D7)",
    "GoThrough(D7)"
  ]
}

This path takes you from CH.1 through SEJOUR and CUISINE to reach CELLIER, then back through CUISINE and SEJOUR to DEGT, and finally to BAINS. It uses only the necessary doors and avoids any unnecessary rooms or detours.
