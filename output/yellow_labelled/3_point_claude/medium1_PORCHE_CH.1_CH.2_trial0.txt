Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
- Porche: Connected to Sejour via D1
- Sejour: Connected to Cuisine via D2 and D3, to Degt via D4
- Cuisine: Connected to Cellier via D2
- Cellier: Connected to Cuisine via D2
- Degt: Connected to CH.1 via D5, to CH.2 via D6, to Bains via D7
- CH.1: Connected to Degt via D5
- CH.2: Connected to Degt via D6
- Bains: Connected to Degt via D7, to WC via D8
- WC: Connected to Bains via D8

Now, for the navigation plan from Porche to CH.1, then to CH.2:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from Porche to CH.1, and then to CH.2, using only the necessary doors along the path.
