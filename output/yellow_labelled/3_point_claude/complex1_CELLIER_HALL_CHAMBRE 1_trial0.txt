Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan as requested.

Rooms and Doors:
- CELLIER: Connected to HALL via D1
- GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER via D9
- BAINS: Connected to HALL via D2
- WC: Connected to HALL via D3
- CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL via D5
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D4
- PORCHE: Connected to HALL via D6
- CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D7
- TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE via D8

Navigation Plan:
To go from CELLIER to HALL to CHAMBRE 1, we only need to use two doors: D1 and D4. Here's the detailed plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D4"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates you from the CELLIER to CHAMBRE 1, passing through the HALL as required, using only the necessary doors D1 and D4.
