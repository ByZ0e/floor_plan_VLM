Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors, and then provide you with a navigation plan as requested.

Rooms and Doors:
- CH. PARENTS: Connected to CUISINE via D3
- CUISINE: Large central area, connected to CH. PARENTS (D3), DOUCHE (D4), CELLIER (D2), and TERRASSE COUVERTE (D1)
- DOUCHE: Connected to CUISINE via D4
- CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE via D2
- TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE via D1

Now, let's create the navigation plan from CH. PARENTS to CUISINE to DOUCHE:

{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
  ]
}

This plan efficiently guides you from CH. PARENTS to CUISINE and then to DOUCHE using the necessary doors D3 and D4. It avoids any unnecessary rooms or doors, providing a direct path to your destination.
