First, let me describe the rooms and doors as shown in the floor plan:

Rooms:
- GARAGE
- PORCHE
- CELLIER (3 separate areas labeled)
- HALL (multiple areas)
- WC
- LINGERIE
- BUREAU
- BAINS
- CHAMBRE PARENTS
- CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
- CHAMBRE ENFANT 2

Doors:
D1: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER
D2: Connects CELLIER to PORCHE
D3: Connects PORCHE to HALL
D4: Connects HALL to WC
D5: Connects HALL to LINGERIE
D6: Connects HALL to BUREAU
D7: Connects HALL to BAINS
D8: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE PARENTS
D9: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
D10: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
D11: Connects CELLIER to HALL

Now, for the navigation plan from GARAGE to CELLIER to WC:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
  ]
}
```

This path takes you from the GARAGE through D1 into the CELLIER, then through D11 into the HALL, and finally through D4 to reach the WC. This is the most direct and efficient route based on the floor plan provided.
