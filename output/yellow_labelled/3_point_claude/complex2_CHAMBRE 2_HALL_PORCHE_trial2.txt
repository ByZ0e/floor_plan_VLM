Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout and provide you with a detailed navigation plan as requested. First, let me list out the rooms and doors with their connections:

Rooms and Doors:
- CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL via D2
- HALL: Central area connecting multiple rooms
- PORCHE: Connected to HALL via D5

Now, for the navigation plan from CHAMBRE 2 to PORCHE:

{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(D2)",
    "OpenDoor(D2)",
    "GoThrough(D2)",
    "ApproachDoor(D5)",
    "OpenDoor(D5)",
    "GoThrough(D5)"
  ]
}

This plan will efficiently navigate you from CHAMBRE 2 to PORCHE using the following steps:
1. From CHAMBRE 2, approach door D2.
2. Open door D2.
3. Go through door D2 to enter the HALL.
4. In the HALL, approach door D5.
5. Open door D5.
6. Go through door D5 to reach the PORCHE.

This path avoids any unnecessary doors or rooms and provides the most direct route to your destination. The plan takes into account that doors close after each GoThrough action, so each door is opened before passing through it.
