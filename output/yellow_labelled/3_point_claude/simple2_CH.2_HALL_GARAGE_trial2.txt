First, let me outline the rooms and doors with their connections based on the floor plan:

Rooms and their connections:
- CH.2 connects to HALL via D3
- HALL connects to GARAGE via D4
- GARAGE is the destination

Doors:
D1: Connects BAINS to HALL
D2: Connects CH.1 to HALL
D3: Connects CH.2 to HALL
D4: Connects HALL to GARAGE
D5: Connects CUISINE to HALL

Now, for the navigation plan from CH.2 to GARAGE:

1. Start in CH.2
2. Use D3 to enter HALL
3. Move through HALL
4. Use D4 to enter GARAGE

Here's the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D3"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D3"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D3"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D4"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CH.2 to GARAGE using only the necessary doors (D3 and D4) and passing through the HALL as required. It avoids any unnecessary rooms or doors.
