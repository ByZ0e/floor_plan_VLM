Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first describe the rooms and doors, then provide the navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Descriptions:
- DEGT: Connected to CH.1 via D5, CH.2 via D6, SEJOUR via D4, and BAINS via D7
- CH.1: Connected to DEGT via D5
- CH.2: Connected to DEGT via D6
- SEJOUR: Connected to DEGT via D4, CUISINE via D3, and Porche via D1
- CUISINE: Connected to SEJOUR via D3 and CELLIER via D2
- CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE via D2
- BAINS: Connected to DEGT via D7
- WC: Connected to BAINS via D8

Now, for the navigation plan from DEGT to CH.2, and then to CH.1:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from DEGT to CH.2, then back to DEGT, and finally to CH.1, using only the necessary doors along the path.
