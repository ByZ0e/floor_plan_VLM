Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
- CHAMBRE 1 connects to HALL via D5
- HALL connects to WC via D4
- HALL connects to DOUCHE via D2
- HALL connects to CUISINE via D6
- CUISINE connects to CELLIER via D3
- CELLIER connects to GARAGES via D1

Now, for the navigation plan from CHAMBRE 1 to CELLIER:

1. Start in CHAMBRE 1
2. Use D5 to enter HALL
3. Move through HALL
4. Use D6 to enter CUISINE
5. Use D3 to reach CELLIER

Here's the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from CHAMBRE 1 to CELLIER, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
