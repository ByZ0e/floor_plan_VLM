Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing out the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan for your task.

Room and Door Connections:
- CH.3 connects to SEJOUR through D1 and D2
- CH.2 connects to SEJOUR through D3
- CH.1 connects to SEJOUR through D4
- CUISINE connects to SEJOUR through D5 and D6

Now, for your navigation task from CH.3 to CH.2 to CH.1, here's the efficient path:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
  ]
}
```

This path efficiently navigates you from CH.3 to CH.2 and finally to CH.1 using only the necessary doors. The plan takes into account that doors close after each GoThrough action, so you need to open D3 twice - once to enter CH.2 and once to exit it.
