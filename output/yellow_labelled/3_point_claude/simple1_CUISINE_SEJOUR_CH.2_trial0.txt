Certainly! I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan in JSON format.

Rooms and Doors:
- CUISINE: Connected to SEJOUR via D5
- SEJOUR: Connected to CUISINE via D5, to CH.1 via D4, to CH.2 via D3, and to another part of SEJOUR via D6
- CH.1: Connected to SEJOUR via D4
- CH.2: Connected to SEJOUR via D3
- CH.3: Connected to CH.3 (another part) via D1, and to CH.2 via D2

Navigation Plan:
To go from CUISINE to SEJOUR, then to CH.2, we need to use doors D5 and D3. Here's the JSON format of the efficient navigation plan:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the CUISINE to CH.2 via SEJOUR, using only the necessary doors (D5 and D3) and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
