Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide you with a detailed navigation plan in JSON format.

Rooms and Doors:
- CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL via D2
- GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER via D9
- CELLIER: Connected to GARAGE via D9, to HALL via D1
- HALL: Central area connecting multiple rooms
- CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D7
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D6
- BAINS: Connected to HALL via D3
- WC: Connected to HALL via D4
- PORCHE: Connected to HALL via D5
- TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE via D8

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan to go from CHAMBRE 2 to GARAGE, then to CELLIER:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently guides you from CHAMBRE 2 to GARAGE and then to CELLIER using only the necessary doors. The plan avoids unnecessary rooms and ensures that you use the correct doors to reach your destination.
