Let me first describe the rooms and doors as shown in the floor plan:

Rooms:
- CUISINE (Kitchen)
- SEJOUR (Living Room, multiple areas)
- CH.1 (Bedroom 1)
- CH.2 (Bedroom 2)
- CH.3 (Bedroom 3)

Doors:
- D1: Connects CH.3 to SEJOUR
- D2: Connects CH.3 to CH.2
- D3: Connects CH.2 to SEJOUR
- D4: Connects CH.1 to SEJOUR
- D5: Connects CUISINE to SEJOUR
- D6: Connects CUISINE to SEJOUR (another entrance)

Now, for the navigation plan from CUISINE to CH.3, and then to SEJOUR:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the CUISINE to CH.3 and then to SEJOUR using the necessary doors. It avoids unnecessary detours and ensures that each required room is visited in the correct order.
