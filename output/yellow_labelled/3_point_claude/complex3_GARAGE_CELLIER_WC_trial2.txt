First, let me describe the rooms and doors as shown in the floor plan:

Rooms and their connections:
- GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER via D1
- CELLIER: Connected to GARAGE via D1, to PORCHE via D2, to HALL via D3
- PORCHE: Connected to CELLIER via D2
- HALL: Connected to CELLIER via D3, to WC via D4, to LINGERIE via D5
- WC: Connected to HALL via D4
- LINGERIE: Connected to HALL via D5
- BUREAU: Connected to HALL via D6
- BAINS: Connected to HALL via D7
- CHAMBRE PARENTS: Connected to HALL via D8
- CHAMBRE ENFANT 1: Connected to HALL via D10
- CHAMBRE ENFANT 2: Connected to HALL via D9

Now, for the navigation plan from GARAGE to WC:

{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(D1)",
    "OpenDoor(D1)",
    "GoThrough(D1)",
    "ApproachDoor(D3)",
    "OpenDoor(D3)",
    "GoThrough(D3)",
    "ApproachDoor(D4)",
    "OpenDoor(D4)",
    "GoThrough(D4)"
  ]
}

This path takes you from the GARAGE, through the CELLIER, into the HALL, and finally to the WC, using only the necessary doors along the way.
