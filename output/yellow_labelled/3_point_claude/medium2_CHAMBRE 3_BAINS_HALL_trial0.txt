Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout and provide a detailed navigation plan as requested. First, let me list out the rooms and doors with their connections:

Rooms and Connections:
- CHAMBRE 3: Connected to HALL via D5
- BAINS: Connected to HALL via D4
- HALL: Central area connecting multiple rooms

Doors:
D1: Connects GARAGE and CHAMBRE 1
D2: Connects CHAMBRE 1 and HALL
D3: Connects HALL and WC
D4: Connects HALL and BAINS
D5: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 3
D6: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 2
D7: Connects HALL and CELLIER
D8: Connects HALL and Porche

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan to go from CHAMBRE 3 to BAINS and then to HALL:

{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(D5)",
    "OpenDoor(D5)",
    "GoThrough(D5)",
    "ApproachDoor(D4)",
    "OpenDoor(D4)",
    "GoThrough(D4)",
    "ApproachDoor(D4)",
    "OpenDoor(D4)",
    "GoThrough(D4)"
  ]
}

This plan efficiently navigates from CHAMBRE 3 to BAINS and then to HALL using the necessary doors. It avoids any unnecessary rooms or doors. The plan ensures that you start in CHAMBRE 3, visit BAINS, and end up in HALL as requested.
