I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan.

Rooms and Doors:
- DOUCHE: Connected to CUISINE via D4
- CUISINE: Large central area, connected to DOUCHE (D4), CH. PARENTS (D3), CELLIER (D2), and TERRASSE COUVERTE (D1)
- CH. PARENTS: Connected to CUISINE via D3
- CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE via D2
- TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE via D1

Now, for the navigation plan:

The path from DOUCHE to TERRASSE COUVERTE, then to CELLIER:

1. Start in DOUCHE
2. Go through D4 to enter CUISINE
3. Cross CUISINE to D1
4. Go through D1 to enter TERRASSE COUVERTE
5. Return through D1 to CUISINE
6. Cross CUISINE to D2
7. Go through D2 to reach CELLIER

Here's the detailed plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D2"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D2"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D2"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from DOUCHE to TERRASSE COUVERTE and then to CELLIER, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
