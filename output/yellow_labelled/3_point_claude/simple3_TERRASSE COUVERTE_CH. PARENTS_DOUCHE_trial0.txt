Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan as requested.

Rooms and Doors:
- TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE via D1
- CUISINE: Connected to TERRASSE COUVERTE via D1, to CELLIER via D2, to CH. PARENTS via D3
- CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE via D2
- CH. PARENTS: Connected to CUISINE via D3, to DOUCHE via D4
- DOUCHE: Connected to CH. PARENTS via D4

Now, for the navigation plan from TERRASSE COUVERTE to CH. PARENTS and finally to DOUCHE:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from TERRASSE COUVERTE to CH. PARENTS and finally to DOUCHE using the necessary doors D1, D3, and D4. It avoids unnecessary rooms and doors, providing a direct path to the destination.
