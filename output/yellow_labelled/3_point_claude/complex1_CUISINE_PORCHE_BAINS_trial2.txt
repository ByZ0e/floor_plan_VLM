To begin, I'll list out the rooms and doors with their connections based on the floor plan:

Rooms and their connections:
- CUISINE: Connected to HALL and TERRASSE COUVERTE
- PORCHE: Connected to HALL
- BAINS: Connected to HALL
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL
- CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL
- CELLIER: Connected to HALL and GARAGE
- GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER
- WC: Connected to HALL
- TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE

Doors:
D1: Between CELLIER and HALL
D2: Between WC and HALL
D3: Between WC and HALL
D4: Between CHAMBRE 1 and HALL
D5: Between CHAMBRE 2 and HALL
D6: Between PORCHE and HALL
D7: Between CUISINE and HALL
D8: Between CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Between CELLIER and GARAGE

Now, for the navigation plan from CUISINE to PORCHE to BAINS:

{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(D7)",
    "OpenDoor(D7)",
    "GoThrough(D7)",
    "ApproachDoor(D6)",
    "OpenDoor(D6)",
    "GoThrough(D6)",
    "ApproachDoor(D6)",
    "OpenDoor(D6)",
    "GoThrough(D6)",
    "ApproachDoor(D2)",
    "OpenDoor(D2)",
    "GoThrough(D2)"
  ]
}

This path efficiently navigates from the CUISINE to the PORCHE and then to the BAINS, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
