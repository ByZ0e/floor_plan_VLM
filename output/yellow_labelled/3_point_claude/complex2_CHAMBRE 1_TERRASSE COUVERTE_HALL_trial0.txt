Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan as requested.

Rooms and Doors:
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D6
- CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL via D2
- CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D7, to TERRASSE COUVERTE via D8
- BAINS: Connected to HALL via D3
- WC: Connected to HALL via D4
- GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER via D9
- CELLIER: Connected to CELLIER (another part) via D1
- PORCHE: Connected to HALL via D5
- TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE via D8

Navigation Plan:
To go from CHAMBRE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE, and then to HALL, we need to use the following sequence of actions:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CHAMBRE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE and then to HALL, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
