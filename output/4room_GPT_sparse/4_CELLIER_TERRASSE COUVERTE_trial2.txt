### Navigation Plan

Starting in the CELLIER, the goal is to reach the TERRASSE COUVERTE. Here is the step-by-step navigation plan:

```json
[
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"}
]
```

This plan ensures that you move from the CELLIER to the TERRASSE COUVERTE by passing through the necessary doors in the correct sequence.
