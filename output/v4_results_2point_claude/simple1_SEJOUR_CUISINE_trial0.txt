Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from SEJOUR to CUISINE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects SEJOUR and CH.3
2. D2: Connects CH.3 and CH.2
3. D3: Connects CH.2 and SEJOUR
4. D4: Connects SEJOUR and CH.1
5. D5: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
6. D6: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE

Based on this analysis, the most efficient path from SEJOUR to CUISINE is through door D5.

Here's the step-by-step navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 5
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 5
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 5
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from SEJOUR to CUISINE using only the necessary doors and actions.
