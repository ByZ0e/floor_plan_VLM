Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the CELLIER to the WC.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects CELLIER and SEJOUR
2. D2 connects CELLIER and CUISINE
3. D3 connects CUISINE and SEJOUR
4. D4 connects SEJOUR and DEGT
5. D5 connects CH.1 and DEGT
6. D6 connects CH.2 and DEGT
7. D7 connects DEGT and BAINS
8. D8 connects DEGT and WC

Based on these connections, here's the efficient navigation plan from CELLIER to WC:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates you from the CELLIER to the WC using the necessary doors and rooms. It avoids any unnecessary detours and ensures you reach your destination.
