Certainly! I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections based on the floor plan image, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan from the GARAGE to the BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:

1. D1: Connects CELLIER and HALL
2. D2: Connects CHAMBRE 2 and HALL
3. D3: Connects HALL and BAINS
4. D4: Connects HALL and WC
5. D5: Connects CHAMBRE 2 and PORCHE
6. D6: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 1
7. D7: Connects HALL and CUISINE
8. D8: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
9. D9: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:

{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 9},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}

This navigation plan will efficiently guide you from the GARAGE to the BAINS using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours. The plan takes into account that doors close after each GoThrough action, so we open each door before passing through it.
