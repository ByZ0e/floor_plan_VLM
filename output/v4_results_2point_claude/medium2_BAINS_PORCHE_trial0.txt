Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from BAINS to PORCHE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER
2. D2: Connects CHAMBRE1 and HALL
3. D3: Connects BAINS and HALL
4. D4: Connects BAINS and HALL
5. D5: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE3
6. D6: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE2
7. D7: Connects CELLIER and HALL
8. D8: Connects HALL and PORCHE

Navigation Plan:
To go from BAINS to PORCHE, we need to use the following sequence of actions:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8}
  ]
}
```

This plan takes you from BAINS through the HALL and directly to the PORCHE using the most efficient path available based on the floor plan provided.
