Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from BAINS to TERRASSE COUVERTE.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects CELLIER and HALL
- D2: Connects BAINS and HALL
- D3: Connects WC and HALL
- D4: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 1
- D5: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 2
- D6: Connects HALL and PORCHE
- D7: Connects HALL and CUISINE
- D8: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
- D9: Connects CELLIER and GARAGE

Navigation Plan:
Starting from BAINS to reach TERRASSE COUVERTE, here's the step-by-step plan:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates you from BAINS to TERRASSE COUVERTE using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours. The plan takes you through the HALL and CUISINE to reach your final destination.
