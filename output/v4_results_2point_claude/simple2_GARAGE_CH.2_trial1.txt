Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan to get from the GARAGE to CH.2.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects GARAGE to HALL (near CH.1 and BAINS)
- D2: Connects CH.1 to HALL
- D3: Connects CH.2 to HALL
- D4: Connects GARAGE to CUISINE
- D5: Connects CUISINE to HALL

Navigation Plan:
To get from the GARAGE to CH.2, we need to go through the HALL. Here's the step-by-step plan:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

This plan takes you from the GARAGE, through the HALL, and into CH.2 using the most direct route available based on the floor plan and door connections provided.
