Certainly! I'll analyze the floor plan, create a list of room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from CHAMBRE 1 to HALL.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER
2. D2: Connects CHAMBRE 1 to HALL
3. D3: Connects HALL to WC
4. D4: Connects HALL to BAINS
5. D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 3
6. D6: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 2
7. D7: Connects CELLIER to HALL
8. D8: Connects HALL to Porche

Navigation Plan:
To go from CHAMBRE 1 to HALL, we only need to use one door: D2.

Here's the step-by-step navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 2
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 2
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 2
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from CHAMBRE 1 to HALL using the most direct path available. You'll approach D2, open it, and go through it to reach the HALL. No unnecessary doors or rooms are included in this plan.
