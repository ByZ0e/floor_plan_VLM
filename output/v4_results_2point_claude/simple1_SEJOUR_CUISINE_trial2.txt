Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the SEJOUR to the CUISINE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects SEJOUR and CH.3
2. D2: Connects CH.3 and CH.2
3. D3: Connects CH.2 and SEJOUR
4. D4: Connects SEJOUR and CH.1
5. D5: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
6. D6: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE

For the navigation task from SEJOUR to CUISINE, we can use door D5 or D6. Since D5 appears to be closer to the larger SEJOUR area, we'll use that for a more efficient path.

Navigation Plan:
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5}
  ]
}

This plan will efficiently take you from the SEJOUR to the CUISINE using the most direct path available.
