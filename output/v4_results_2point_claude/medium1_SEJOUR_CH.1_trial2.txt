Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from SEJOUR to CH.1.

Explicit Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects SEJOUR to Porche
- D2: Connects CUISINE to Porche
- D3: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
- D4: Connects SEJOUR to DEGT
- D5: Connects CH.1 to DEGT
- D6: Connects CH.2 to DEGT
- D7: Connects BAINS to DEGT
- D8: Connects WC to DEGT

Navigation Plan:
To go from SEJOUR to CH.1, we only need to use two doors: D4 and D5. Here's the detailed plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from SEJOUR to CH.1 using only the necessary doors. The robot will first exit SEJOUR through D4 into DEGT, then enter CH.1 through D5. No unnecessary rooms or doors are included in this path.
