Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan from BAINS to HALL.

Explicit Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects BAINS to HALL
2. D2: Connects CH.1 to HALL
3. D3: Connects CH.2 to HALL
4. D4: Connects GARAGE to CUISINE
5. D5: Connects CUISINE to HALL

Navigation Plan:
To go from BAINS to HALL, we only need to use one door: D1.

Here's the step-by-step navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from BAINS to HALL using the most direct route available according to the floor plan.
