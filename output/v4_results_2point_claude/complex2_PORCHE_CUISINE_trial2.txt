Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the PORCHE to the CUISINE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
2. D2: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to HALL
3. D3: Connects BAINS to HALL
4. D4: Connects WC to HALL
5. D5: Connects PORCHE to HALL
6. D6: Connects CHAMBRE 1 to HALL
7. D7: Connects CUISINE to HALL
8. D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
9. D9: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER

Navigation Plan:
To go from PORCHE to CUISINE, we need to use the following sequence of actions:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the PORCHE to the CUISINE using only the necessary doors. It starts by exiting the PORCHE through D5 into the HALL, and then enters the CUISINE through D7. No unnecessary rooms or doors are included in this path.
