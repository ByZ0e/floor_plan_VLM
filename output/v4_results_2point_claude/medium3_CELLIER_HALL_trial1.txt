Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the CELLIER to the HALL.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects GARAGES and CELLIER
D2: Connects GARAGES and HALL (near DOUCHE)
D3: Connects CELLIER and CUISINE
D4: Connects HALL (near WC) and HALL (central area)
D5: Connects HALL (central area) and CHAMBRE 1
D6: Connects CUISINE and HALL (central area)
D7: Connects CUISINE and HALL (lower area)

Now, let's create the navigation plan from CELLIER to HALL:

{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6}
  ]
}

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the CELLIER to the HALL using the following steps:
1. Approach Door 3 (between CELLIER and CUISINE)
2. Open Door 3
3. Go through Door 3 into the CUISINE
4. Approach Door 6 (between CUISINE and central HALL)
5. Open Door 6
6. Go through Door 6 into the HALL

This path avoids unnecessary doors and rooms, providing a direct route to the destination. The plan ensures that you'll end up in the HALL area as requested.
