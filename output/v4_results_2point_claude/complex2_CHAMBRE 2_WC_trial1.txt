Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
- D2: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to HALL
- D3: Connects HALL to BAINS
- D4: Connects HALL to WC
- D5: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to PORCHE
- D6: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
- D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE
- D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
- D9: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER

Navigation Plan:
To go from CHAMBRE 2 to WC, we need to use doors D2 and D4. Here's the step-by-step plan:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CHAMBRE 2 to WC using only the necessary doors. The robot will exit CHAMBRE 2 through D2 into the HALL, then approach and go through D4 to reach the WC.
