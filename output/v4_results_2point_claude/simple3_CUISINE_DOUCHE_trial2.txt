Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan to go from CUISINE to DOUCHE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CUISINE connects to TERRASSE COUVERTE via D1
2. CUISINE connects to CELLIER via D2
3. CUISINE connects to CH. PARENTS via D3
4. CH. PARENTS connects to DOUCHE via D4

Navigation Plan:
To go from CUISINE to DOUCHE, we need to pass through CH. PARENTS. Here's the step-by-step plan:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the CUISINE to the DOUCHE using only the necessary doors (D3 and D4) and passing through the CH. PARENTS room. The plan avoids unnecessary rooms and doors, providing a direct path to the destination.
