Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from DEGT to PORCHE.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects SEJOUR and PORCHE
D2: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
D3: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
D5: Connects DEGT and CH.1
D6: Connects DEGT and CH.2
D7: Connects DEGT and BAINS
D8: Connects DEGT and WC

Now, let's create the navigation plan from DEGT to PORCHE:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from DEGT to PORCHE using the following steps:
1. Approach Door 4 (D4), which connects DEGT to SEJOUR.
2. Open Door 4.
3. Go through Door 4 to enter SEJOUR.
4. Approach Door 1 (D1), which connects SEJOUR to PORCHE.
5. Open Door 1.
6. Go through Door 1 to reach the PORCHE.

This path is the most direct route from DEGT to PORCHE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
