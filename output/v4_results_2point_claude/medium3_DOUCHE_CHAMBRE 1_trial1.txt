Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan to get from the DOUCHE to CHAMBRE 1.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects GARAGES to CELLIER
- D2: Connects GARAGES to DOUCHE
- D3: Connects CELLIER to CUISINE
- D4: Connects WC to HALL
- D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
- D6: Connects HALL to CUISINE
- D7: Connects CUISINE to HALL

Navigation Plan:
To get from DOUCHE to CHAMBRE 1, we need to go through the following doors: D2, D6, and D5.

Here's the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the DOUCHE to CHAMBRE 1 using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
