Certainly! I'll analyze the floor plan, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan for you to move from the GARAGE to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER
D2: Connects CELLIER to PORCHE
D3: Connects PORCHE to HALL
D4: Connects HALL to WC
D5: Connects HALL to LINGERIE
D6: Connects HALL to BUREAU
D7: Connects HALL to BAINS
D8: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE PARENTS
D9: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
D10: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
D11: Connects CELLIER to HALL

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan from GARAGE to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "doorNumber": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "doorNumber": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "doorNumber": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "doorNumber": 11},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "doorNumber": 11},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "doorNumber": 11},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "doorNumber": 10},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "doorNumber": 10},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "doorNumber": 10}
  ]
}
```

This plan takes you from the GARAGE through the CELLIER and into the HALL, then directly to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1. It's the most efficient path based on the floor plan provided, avoiding any unnecessary doors or rooms.
