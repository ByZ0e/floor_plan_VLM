Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan from CHAMBRE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects CELLIER and HALL
2. D2: Connects BAINS and HALL
3. D3: Connects WC and HALL
4. D4: Connects CHAMBRE 1 and HALL
5. D5: Connects CHAMBRE 2 and HALL
6. D6: Connects PORCHE and HALL
7. D7: Connects CUISINE and HALL
8. D8: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
9. D9: Connects CELLIER and GARAGE

Navigation Plan:
To go from CHAMBRE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE, we need to use the following sequence of actions:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from CHAMBRE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
