Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan to go from the GARAGES to the CELLIER.

Explicit Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects GARAGES to CELLIER
- D2: Connects GARAGES to DOUCHE
- D3: Connects CELLIER to CUISINE
- D4: Connects WC to HALL
- D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
- D6: Connects HALL to CUISINE
- D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE (second instance)

Navigation Plan:
To go from GARAGES to CELLIER, we only need to use one door: D1.

Here's the JSON format for the navigation plan:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the GARAGES to the CELLIER using the most direct path available, which is through door D1.
