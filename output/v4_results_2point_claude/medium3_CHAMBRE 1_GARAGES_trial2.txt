Certainly! I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections based on the floor plan image, and then provide a detailed navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CHAMBRE 1 <-> D5 <-> HALL
2. HALL <-> D2 <-> DOUCHE
3. HALL <-> D4 <-> WC
4. HALL <-> D6 <-> CUISINE
5. CUISINE <-> D3 <-> CELLIER
6. CELLIER <-> D1 <-> GARAGES
7. CUISINE <-> D7 <-> HALL (lower part)

Now, let's create the navigation plan to go from CHAMBRE 1 to GARAGES:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan will efficiently guide you from CHAMBRE 1 to GARAGES using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours. The plan takes into account that doors close after each GoThrough action, so each door is approached, opened, and gone through in sequence.
