Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the CELLIER to the HALL.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
2. D2: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to HALL
3. D3: Connects HALL to BAINS
4. D4: Connects HALL to WC
5. D5: Connects HALL to PORCHE
6. D6: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
7. D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE
8. D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
9. D9: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER

Navigation Plan:
To go from the CELLIER to the HALL, we only need to use one door: D1. Here's the step-by-step plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D1"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently take you from the CELLIER to the HALL using the most direct route available according to the floor plan.
