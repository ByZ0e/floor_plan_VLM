Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from SEJOUR to CH.1.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

1. SEJOUR connects to CUISINE through D1
2. SEJOUR connects to DEGT through D4
3. CUISINE connects to CELLIER through D2
4. CUISINE connects to another part of CUISINE through D3
5. DEGT connects to CH.1 through D5
6. DEGT connects to CH.2 through D6
7. DEGT connects to BAINS through D7
8. DEGT connects to WC through D8

Now, for the navigation plan from SEJOUR to CH.1:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from SEJOUR to CH.1 using the necessary doors. The path avoids any unnecessary rooms or doors, ensuring a direct route to the destination.
