Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan from PORCHE to CUISINE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
2. D2: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to HALL
3. D3: Connects BAINS to HALL
4. D4: Connects WC to HALL
5. D5: Connects PORCHE to HALL
6. D6: Connects CHAMBRE 1 to HALL
7. D7: Connects CUISINE to HALL
8. D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
9. D9: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER

Navigation Plan from PORCHE to CUISINE:
Based on the floor plan and the connections listed above, here's the efficient navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from PORCHE to CUISINE using only the necessary doors. The robot starts in PORCHE, goes through D5 to enter the HALL, and then through D7 to reach the CUISINE. No unnecessary doors or rooms are included in this path.
