Certainly! I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections based on the floor plan image, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from the WC to CHAMBRE 2.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER
2. D2: Connects CHAMBRE 1 to HALL
3. D3: Connects WC to HALL
4. D4: Connects BAINS to HALL
5. D5: Connects CHAMBRE 3 to HALL
6. D6: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to HALL
7. D7: Connects CELLIER to HALL
8. D8: Connects HALL to Porche

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
To navigate from the WC to CHAMBRE 2, we need to use the following sequence of actions:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the WC to CHAMBRE 2 using only the necessary doors. The robot will start in the WC, exit through D3 into the HALL, and then enter CHAMBRE 2 through D6. No unnecessary rooms or doors are included in this path.
