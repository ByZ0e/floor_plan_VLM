Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan to get from CHAMBRE 2 to WC.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
- D2: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to HALL
- D3: Connects HALL to BAINS
- D4: Connects HALL to WC
- D5: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to PORCHE
- D6: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
- D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE
- D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
- D9: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER

Navigation Plan from CHAMBRE 2 to WC:

Based on the floor plan and the connections listed above, here's the efficient navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan takes you from CHAMBRE 2 to the WC using the most direct route. You'll exit CHAMBRE 2 through door D2 into the HALL, then proceed to door D4 which leads directly to the WC. This is the most efficient path based on the floor plan provided.
