Certainly! I'll analyze the floor plan, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan for you to move from the CELLIER to the WC.

Room and Door Connections:

D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
D2: Connects HALL to BAINS
D3: Connects HALL to WC
D4: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 2
D6: Connects HALL to PORCHE
D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE
D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE

Now, let's create the navigation plan to go from CELLIER to WC:

{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}

This plan efficiently navigates you from the CELLIER to the WC using the following steps:
1. Approach Door 1 (connecting CELLIER to HALL)
2. Open Door 1
3. Go through Door 1 to enter the HALL
4. Approach Door 3 (connecting HALL to WC)
5. Open Door 3
6. Go through Door 3 to enter the WC

This is the most direct and efficient path from the CELLIER to the WC, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
