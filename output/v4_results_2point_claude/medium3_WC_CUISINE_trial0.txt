Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. Let me first list out the rooms and doors with their connections based on the image:

Room and Door Connections:
- WC connects to Hall through D4
- Hall connects to Douche through D2
- Hall connects to Chambre 1 through D5
- Hall connects to Cuisine through D6
- Cuisine connects to Cellier through D3
- Garages connects to Cellier through D1
- Cuisine connects to Hall through D7

Now, let's create the navigation plan to go from WC to Cuisine:

1. ApproachDoor(4)
2. OpenDoor(4)
3. GoThrough(4)
4. ApproachDoor(6)
5. OpenDoor(6)
6. GoThrough(6)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6}
  ]
}
```

This path takes you from the WC, through the Hall, and directly into the Cuisine using the most efficient route based on the provided floor plan and door connections.
