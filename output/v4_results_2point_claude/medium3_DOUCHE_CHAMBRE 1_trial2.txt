Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list the rooms and their door connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the DOUCHE to CHAMBRE 1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. DOUCHE: Connected to HALL via D2
2. HALL: Connected to DOUCHE via D2, WC via D4, CHAMBRE 1 via D5, CUISINE via D6
3. WC: Connected to HALL via D4
4. CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D5
5. CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D6, CELLIER via D3, HALL (lower part) via D7
6. CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE via D3
7. GARAGES: Connected to CELLIER via D1

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan to go from DOUCHE to CHAMBRE 1:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the DOUCHE to CHAMBRE 1 using the necessary doors. You'll start by exiting the DOUCHE through door D2 into the HALL, then proceed directly to door D5 to enter CHAMBRE 1.
