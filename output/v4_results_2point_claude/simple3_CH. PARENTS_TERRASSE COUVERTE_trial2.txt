Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan to get from CH. PARENTS to TERRASSE COUVERTE.

Explicit Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
2. D2: Connects CUISINE to CELLIER
3. D3: Connects CUISINE to CH. PARENTS
4. D4: Connects CH. PARENTS to DOUCHE

Navigation Plan:
To get from CH. PARENTS to TERRASSE COUVERTE, we need to go through the CUISINE. Here's the step-by-step plan:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from CH. PARENTS to TERRASSE COUVERTE using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
