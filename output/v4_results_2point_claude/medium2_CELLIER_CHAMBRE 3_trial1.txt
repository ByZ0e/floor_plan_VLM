Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list the rooms and their door connections, then provide the navigation plan to get from the CELLIER to CHAMBRE 3.

Room and Door Connections:
1. GARAGE: D1 connects to CELLIER
2. CELLIER: D1 connects to GARAGE, D7 connects to HALL
3. CHAMBRE 1: D2 connects to HALL
4. BAINS: D4 connects to HALL
5. WC: D3 connects to HALL
6. CHAMBRE 2: D6 connects to HALL
7. CHAMBRE 3: D5 connects to HALL
8. HALL: Connects to multiple rooms (D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7)
9. Porche: D8 connects to HALL

Navigation Plan:
To go from CELLIER to CHAMBRE 3, we need to use the following sequence of actions:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the CELLIER to CHAMBRE 3 using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
