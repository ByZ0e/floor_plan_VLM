Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan to get from the GARAGE to CHAMBRE 2.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
D2: Connects BAINS to HALL
D3: Connects WC to HALL
D4: Connects CHAMBRE 1 to HALL
D5: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to HALL
D6: Connects PORCHE to HALL
D7: Connects CUISINE to HALL
D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER

Navigation Plan:
To go from GARAGE to CHAMBRE 2, we need to use the following sequence of actions:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 9},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5}
  ]
}
```

This path takes you from the GARAGE through the CELLIER and HALL to reach CHAMBRE 2 efficiently, using only the necessary doors along the way.
