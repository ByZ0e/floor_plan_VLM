Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from CH.1 to CH.2.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects CH.3 and SEJOUR
- D2: Connects CH.2 and SEJOUR
- D3: Connects CH.2 and SEJOUR
- D4: Connects CH.1 and SEJOUR
- D5: Connects CUISINE and SEJOUR
- D6: Connects CUISINE and SEJOUR

Now, let's create the navigation plan from CH.1 to CH.2:

{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}

This plan efficiently navigates from CH.1 to CH.2 using the minimum necessary steps:
1. Exit CH.1 through D4 into the SEJOUR.
2. From the SEJOUR, enter CH.2 through D3.

This path avoids unnecessary rooms and doors, providing a direct route to the destination.
