Certainly! I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections based on the floor plan, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan from the CELLIER to the WC.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
2. D2: Connects HALL to BAINS
3. D3: Connects HALL to WC
4. D4: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
5. D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 2
6. D6: Connects HALL to PORCHE
7. D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE
8. D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
9. D9: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE

Navigation Plan:
To go from the CELLIER to the WC, we need to use two doors: D1 and D3. Here's the step-by-step plan:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the CELLIER to the WC using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors. The plan takes into account that doors close after each GoThrough action, so we open each door before going through it.
