Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and their door connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the GARAGE to CHAMBRE 2.

Room and Door Connections:
1. GARAGE: D9 connects to CELLIER
2. CELLIER: D9 connects to GARAGE, D1 connects to HALL
3. BAINS: D2 connects to HALL
4. WC: D3 connects to HALL
5. CHAMBRE 1: D4 connects to HALL
6. CHAMBRE 2: D5 connects to HALL
7. PORCHE: D6 connects to HALL
8. CUISINE: D7 connects to HALL, D8 connects to TERRASSE COUVERTE
9. HALL: Connects to multiple rooms (D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7)
10. TERRASSE COUVERTE: D8 connects to CUISINE

Navigation Plan:
To go from GARAGE to CHAMBRE 2, we need to use the following doors: D9, D1, and D5.

Here's the step-by-step navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 9},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the GARAGE to CHAMBRE 2 using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
