Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the CHAMBRE PARENTS to the CELLIER.

Room and Door Connections:
D8: Connects CHAMBRE PARENTS to HALL
D7: Connects HALL to BAINS
D6: Connects HALL to BUREAU
D5: Connects HALL to LINGERIE
D4: Connects HALL to WC
D3: Connects HALL to PORCHE
D2: Connects PORCHE to CELLIER
D1: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE
D9: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
D10: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
D11: Connects HALL to CELLIER

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan from CHAMBRE PARENTS to CELLIER:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 11}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the CHAMBRE PARENTS to the CELLIER using the most direct route available. It avoids unnecessary doors and rooms, using only the required connections to reach the destination.
