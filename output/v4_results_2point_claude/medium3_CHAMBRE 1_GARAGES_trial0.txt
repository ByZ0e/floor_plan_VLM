Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from CHAMBRE 1 to GARAGES.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects GARAGES to CELLIER
- D2: Connects GARAGES to HALL (near DOUCHE)
- D3: Connects CELLIER to CUISINE
- D4: Connects WC to HALL
- D5: Connects CHAMBRE 1 to HALL
- D6: Connects CUISINE to HALL
- D7: Connects CUISINE to HALL (lower part)

Navigation Plan:
To go from CHAMBRE 1 to GARAGES, we need to use doors D5 and D2. Here's the detailed plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 5
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 5
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 5
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 2
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 2
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 2
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from CHAMBRE 1 to GARAGES using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
