Thank you for providing the floor plan. Let me first list out the rooms and doors with their connections based on the image:

Room and Door Connections:
1. CH.1 is connected to SEJOUR through D4
2. CH.2 is connected to SEJOUR through D3
3. CH.2 is also connected to CH.3 through D2
4. CH.3 is connected to SEJOUR through D1
5. CUISINE is connected to SEJOUR through D6
6. CUISINE is also connected to another part of SEJOUR through D5

Now, for the navigation task from CH.1 to CH.2, here's the detailed plan:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently guides you from CH.1 to CH.2 using the necessary doors. You'll start in CH.1, go through D4 to enter the SEJOUR area, and then use D3 to reach CH.2. This is the most direct path based on the floor plan provided.
