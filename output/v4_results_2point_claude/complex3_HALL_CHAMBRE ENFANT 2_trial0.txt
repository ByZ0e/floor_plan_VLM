Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll begin by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan to reach CHAMBRE ENFANT 2 from the HALL.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: GARAGE <-> CELLIER
- D2: CELLIER <-> PORCHE
- D3: PORCHE <-> HALL
- D4: HALL <-> WC
- D5: HALL <-> LINGERIE
- D6: HALL <-> BUREAU
- D7: HALL <-> BAINS
- D8: HALL <-> CHAMBRE PARENTS
- D9: HALL <-> CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
- D10: HALL <-> CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
- D11: CELLIER <-> HALL

Navigation Plan:
To navigate from the HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2, we only need to use one door: D9.

Here's the action sequence in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 9
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 9
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 9
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from the HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2 using only the necessary door (D9) for traversal.
