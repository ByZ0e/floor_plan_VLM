Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the CUISINE to the DOUCHE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CUISINE (top left) - D2 - CELLIER
2. CUISINE (main area) - D1 - TERRASSE COUVERTE
3. CUISINE (main area) - D3 - CH. PARENTS
4. CH. PARENTS - D4 - DOUCHE

Navigation Plan:
To get from the CUISINE to the DOUCHE, we need to go through the main CUISINE area, then through CH. PARENTS, and finally to the DOUCHE. Here's the step-by-step plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the CUISINE to the DOUCHE using only the necessary doors (D3 and D4) and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
