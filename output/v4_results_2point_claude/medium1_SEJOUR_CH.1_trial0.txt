Thank you for providing the floor plan image and the navigation task. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects SEJOUR to Porche
- D2: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
- D3: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
- D4: Connects SEJOUR to DEGT
- D5: Connects CH.1 to DEGT
- D6: Connects CH.2 to DEGT
- D7: Connects BAINS to DEGT
- D8: Connects WC to DEGT

Now, for the navigation task from SEJOUR to CH.1:

The most efficient path is to go directly from SEJOUR to DEGT, and then from DEGT to CH.1. Here's the step-by-step navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 5
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 5
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 5
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from SEJOUR to CH.1 using only the necessary doors (D4 and D5) and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
