Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from CH.1 to the GARAGE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects CH.1 and HALL
2. D2 connects CH.1 and HALL
3. D3 connects CH.2 and HALL
4. D4 connects GARAGE and CUISINE
5. D5 connects CUISINE and HALL

Based on these connections, here's the navigation plan from CH.1 to GARAGE:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates you from CH.1 to the GARAGE using the minimum number of necessary doors. It avoids unnecessary rooms and ensures you reach your destination following the layout of the building.
