Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the DOUCHE to the CELLIER.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

Rooms:
1. DOUCHE
2. CH. PARENTS
3. CUISINE (multiple instances)
4. CELLIER
5. TERRASSE COUVERTE

Doors and their connections:
D1: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE and CUISINE
D2: Connects CUISINE and CELLIER
D3: Connects CUISINE and CH. PARENTS
D4: Connects CH. PARENTS and DOUCHE

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan from DOUCHE to CELLIER:

{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2}
  ]
}

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the DOUCHE to the CELLIER using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
