Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan from the CUISINE to CH.2.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
D2: Connects CUISINE and CELLIER
D3: Connects CUISINE and SEJOUR
D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
D5: Connects CH.1 and DEGT
D6: Connects DEGT and CH.2
D7: Connects DEGT and BAINS
D8: Connects CUISINE and DEGT

Navigation Plan:
To go from CUISINE to CH.2, we need to use the following sequence of actions:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6}
  ]
}
```

This plan takes you from the CUISINE through D8 into the DEGT (hallway), and then through D6 into CH.2, which is your final destination. This is the most direct and efficient route based on the floor plan provided.
