Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to the CUISINE.

Room and Door Connections:

1. TERRASSE COUVERTE:
   - Connected to CUISINE via D1

2. CUISINE (large central area):
   - Connected to TERRASSE COUVERTE via D1
   - Connected to CELLIER via D2
   - Connected to CH. PARENTS via D3

3. CELLIER:
   - Connected to CUISINE via D2

4. CH. PARENTS:
   - Connected to CUISINE via D3
   - Connected to DOUCHE via D4

5. DOUCHE:
   - Connected to CH. PARENTS via D4

Navigation Plan:

To go from TERRASSE COUVERTE to CUISINE, we only need to use one door (D1). Here's the step-by-step plan:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently move you from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to the CUISINE using the most direct path available.
