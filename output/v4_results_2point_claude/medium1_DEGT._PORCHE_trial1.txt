Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from DEGT to PORCHE.

Room and Door Connections:
- D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
- D5: Connects CH.1 and DEGT
- D6: Connects CH.2 and DEGT
- D7: Connects BAINS and DEGT
- D8: Connects WC and DEGT
- D3: Connects CUISINE and SEJOUR
- D2: Connects CUISINE and CELLIER
- D1: Connects SEJOUR and PORCHE

Navigation Plan:
To go from DEGT to PORCHE, we need to use the following doors: D4 and D1.

Here's the step-by-step navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D1"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the DEGT to the PORCHE using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
