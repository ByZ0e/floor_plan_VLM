Thank you for providing the floor plan. Let me first list out the rooms and doors with their connections based on the image:

Rooms and Door Connections:
1. CELLIER connects to CUISINE through D2
2. CUISINE (top left) connects to TERRASSE COUVERTE through D1
3. CUISINE (large central area) connects to CH. PARENTS through D3
4. CH. PARENTS connects to DOUCHE through D4

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan to go from CELLIER to CH. PARENTS:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently guide you from the CELLIER to CH. PARENTS using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours. The plan takes you through the CUISINE area to reach your destination.
