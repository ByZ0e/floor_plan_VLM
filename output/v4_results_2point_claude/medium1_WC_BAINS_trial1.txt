Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the WC to the BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects SEJOUR and Porche
2. D2: Connects CUISINE and Porche
3. D3: Connects CUISINE and SEJOUR
4. D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
5. D5: Connects CH.1 and DEGT
6. D6: Connects CH.2 and DEGT
7. D7: Connects BAINS and DEGT
8. D8: Connects WC and DEGT

Navigation Plan:
To go from the WC to the BAINS, we only need to use one door. Here's the step-by-step plan:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the WC to the BAINS using only the necessary doors. You'll exit the WC into the DEGT (dégagement or hallway) and then enter the BAINS from there.
