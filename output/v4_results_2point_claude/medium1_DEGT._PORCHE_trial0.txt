Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from DEGT to PORCHE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects SEJOUR to PORCHE
2. D2: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
3. D3: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
4. D4: Connects SEJOUR to DEGT
5. D5: Connects CH.1 to DEGT
6. D6: Connects CH.2 to DEGT
7. D7: Connects BAINS to DEGT
8. D8: Connects WC to DEGT

Navigation Plan:
To go from DEGT to PORCHE, we need to use doors D4 and D1. Here's the step-by-step plan:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from DEGT to PORCHE using the necessary doors. The robot will start in DEGT, go through D4 to enter SEJOUR, and then use D1 to reach PORCHE. No unnecessary rooms or doors are included in this path.
