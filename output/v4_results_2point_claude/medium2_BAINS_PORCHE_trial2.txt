Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Garage <-> Cellier
- D2: Chambre 1 <-> Hall
- D3: Bains <-> Hall
- D4: Bains <-> Hall
- D5: Hall <-> Chambre 3
- D6: Hall <-> Chambre 2
- D7: Cellier <-> Hall
- D8: Hall <-> Porche

Now, for the navigation plan from Bains to Porche:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from Bains to Porche using the available doors. It avoids unnecessary rooms and uses only the required doors for traversal. The robot will exit the Bains through D4, enter the Hall, and then proceed directly to the Porche through D8.
