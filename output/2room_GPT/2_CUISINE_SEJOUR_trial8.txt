### Navigation Plan

Starting in the CUISINE and aiming to reach the SEJOUR, the necessary doors to traverse are D3.

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"}
  ]
}
```

This plan ensures that you move from the CUISINE to the SEJOUR by approaching, opening, and going through door D3.
