### Navigation Plan

Starting in the CUISINE and aiming to arrive at the SEJOUR, the sequence of actions is as follows:

```json
[
  {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
  {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
  {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"}
]
```

This plan ensures that you move from the CUISINE to the SEJOUR by using Door D3.
