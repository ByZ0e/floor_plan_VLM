### Navigation Plan

Starting in the HALL and aiming to reach the WC, the sequence of actions is as follows:

```json
[
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
]
```

This plan ensures that you move from the HALL to the WC by approaching, opening, and going through door D4.
