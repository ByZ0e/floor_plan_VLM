### Navigation Plan

Starting in the WC and aiming to arrive at the HALL, the sequence of actions is as follows:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"}
  ]
}
```

### Explanation

1. **ApproachDoor(D3)**: Move in front of door D3, which connects WC to HALL.
2. **OpenDoor(D3)**: Open door D3.
3. **GoThrough(D3)**: Move through door D3 to enter the HALL.

This plan ensures that you move from the WC to the HALL efficiently, using only the necessary door (D3).
