Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide the navigation plan.

Rooms and Doors:
1. CH.1 - connected to SEJOUR via D4
2. CH.2 - connected to SEJOUR via D3 and to CH.3 via D2
3. CH.3 - connected to CH.2 via D2 and to SEJOUR via D1
4. SEJOUR (multiple instances) - connected to CH.1 via D4, CH.2 via D3, CH.3 via D1, and CUISINE via D6
5. CUISINE - connected to SEJOUR via D6 and D5

Navigation Plan:
To go from CH.1 to CH.2, we need to use the SEJOUR as an intermediary space. Here's the step-by-step plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D3"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D3"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D3"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CH.1 to CH.2 using only the necessary doors (D4 and D3) and avoiding any unnecessary detours or rooms.
