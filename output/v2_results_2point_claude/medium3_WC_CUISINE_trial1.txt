Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
- WC:
  - D4 connects to Hall
- Hall:
  - D4 connects to WC
  - D5 connects to Chambre 1
  - D6 connects to Cuisine
- Chambre 1:
  - D5 connects to Hall
- Cuisine:
  - D6 connects to Hall
  - D3 connects to Cellier

Navigation Plan:
To go from the WC to the Cuisine, we need to use the following path: WC -> Hall -> Cuisine.

Here's the JSON format of the action sequence:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the WC to the Cuisine using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
