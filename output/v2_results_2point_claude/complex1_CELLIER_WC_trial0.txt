Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan to get from the CELLIER to the WC.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
- D2: Connects HALL to BAINS
- D3: Connects HALL to WC
- D4: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
- D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 2
- D6: Connects HALL to PORCHE
- D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE
- D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
- D9: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE

Navigation Plan:
To go from CELLIER to WC, we need to use two doors: D1 and D3. Here's the step-by-step plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the CELLIER to the WC using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
