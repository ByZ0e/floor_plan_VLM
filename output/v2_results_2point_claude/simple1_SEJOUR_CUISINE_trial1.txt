Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first describe the rooms and doors, then provide the navigation plan.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

Rooms:
- SEJOUR (multiple areas)
- CH.1
- CH.2
- CH.3
- CUISINE

Doors and their connections:
D1: Connects SEJOUR to CH.3
D2: Connects CH.3 to CH.2
D3: Connects CH.2 to SEJOUR
D4: Connects SEJOUR to CH.1
D5: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
D6: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE

Navigation Plan:
To go from SEJOUR to CUISINE, we only need to use one door. The most direct path is through D5 or D6. Since D5 appears to be closer to the main SEJOUR area, we'll use that one.

Here's the step-by-step navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 5
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 5
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 5
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently guide you from the SEJOUR to the CUISINE using the most direct route available.
