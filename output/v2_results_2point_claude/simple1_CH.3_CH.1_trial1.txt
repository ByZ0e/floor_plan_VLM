Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from CH.3 to CH.1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CH.3 connects to SEJOUR through D1
2. CH.3 connects to CH.2 through D2
3. CH.2 connects to SEJOUR through D3
4. SEJOUR connects to CH.1 through D4
5. SEJOUR connects to CUISINE through D5
6. SEJOUR connects to CUISINE through D6

Now, for the navigation plan from CH.3 to CH.1:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
  ]
}
```

This plan takes you from CH.3 through CH.2 and SEJOUR to reach CH.1, using the most direct path available based on the door connections.
