Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from DEGT to PORCHE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects SEJOUR to PORCHE
2. D2: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
3. D3: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
4. D4: Connects SEJOUR to DEGT
5. D5: Connects CH.1 to DEGT
6. D6: Connects CH.2 to DEGT
7. D7: Connects BAINS to DEGT
8. D8: Connects WC to DEGT

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan from DEGT to PORCHE:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from DEGT to PORCHE using the following steps:
1. From DEGT, approach door D4
2. Open door D4
3. Go through door D4 to enter SEJOUR
4. In SEJOUR, approach door D1
5. Open door D1
6. Go through door D1 to reach PORCHE

This is the most direct and efficient path based on the provided floor plan, using only the necessary doors to reach the destination.
