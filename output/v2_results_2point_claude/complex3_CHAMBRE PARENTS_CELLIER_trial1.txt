Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan to get from CHAMBRE PARENTS to CELLIER.

Room and Door Connections:
- D8: Connects CHAMBRE PARENTS to HALL
- D7: Connects HALL to BAINS
- D6: Connects HALL to BUREAU
- D5: Connects HALL to LINGERIE
- D4: Connects HALL to WC
- D3: Connects HALL to PORCHE
- D2: Connects PORCHE to CELLIER
- D1: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE
- D9: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
- D10: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
- D11: Connects HALL to CELLIER

Navigation Plan:
To get from CHAMBRE PARENTS to CELLIER, we'll use the following path:
CHAMBRE PARENTS -> D8 -> HALL -> D11 -> CELLIER

Here's the step-by-step navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 11}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from CHAMBRE PARENTS to CELLIER using the available doors. The robot will exit the CHAMBRE PARENTS through D8, enter the HALL, and then use D11 to reach the CELLIER.
