Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the connections and provide a navigation plan as requested.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects Garage to Hall
D2: Connects Chambre 1 to Hall
D3: Connects Hall to WC
D4: Connects Bains to Hall
D5: Connects Hall to Chambre 3
D6: Connects Hall to Chambre 2
D7: Connects Cellier to Hall
D8: Connects Hall to Porche

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan from Bains to Porche:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8}
  ]
}
```

This plan takes you from Bains to Porche using the most direct route available. You'll exit Bains through D4, enter the Hall, and then exit the Hall through D8 to reach the Porche. This is the most efficient path based on the floor plan provided.
