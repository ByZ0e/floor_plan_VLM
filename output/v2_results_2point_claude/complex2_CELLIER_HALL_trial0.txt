Certainly! I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections based on the floor plan image, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the CELLIER to the HALL.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
2. D2: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to HALL
3. D3: Connects HALL to BAINS
4. D4: Connects HALL to WC
5. D5: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to HALL (near PORCHE)
6. D6: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
7. D7: Connects CUISINE to HALL
8. D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
9. D9: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER

Now, for the navigation plan from CELLIER to HALL:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan is the most efficient and correct path from the CELLIER to the HALL. Here's a breakdown of the steps:

1. ApproachDoor(1): Move towards door D1, which connects the CELLIER to the HALL.
2. OpenDoor(1): Open door D1.
3. GoThrough(1): Pass through door D1 to enter the HALL.

After completing these steps, you will have successfully navigated from the CELLIER to the HALL using the most direct route available according to the floor plan.
