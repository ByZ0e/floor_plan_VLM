Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. Let me first list out the rooms and doors with their connections based on the image:

Room and Door Connections:
1. WC connects to DEGT through D8
2. DEGT connects to CH.2 through D6
3. DEGT connects to CH.1 through D5
4. DEGT connects to SEJOUR through D4
5. SEJOUR connects to CUISINE through D3
6. CUISINE connects to CELLIER through D2
7. SEJOUR connects to Porche through D1
8. DEGT connects to BAINS through D7

Now, for the navigation task to go from WC to BAINS, here's the detailed plan:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the WC to the BAINS using only the necessary doors. The robot starts in the WC, goes through D8 to enter the DEGT (dégagement or hallway), and then uses D7 to reach the BAINS. This is the most direct path based on the floor plan provided.
