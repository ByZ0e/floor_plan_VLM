Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms and doors, create a list of connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the CELLIER to the CH. PARENTS.

Rooms and Door Connections:
1. CELLIER connects to CUISINE via D2
2. CUISINE connects to TERRASSE COUVERTE via D1
3. CUISINE connects to CH. PARENTS via D3
4. CH. PARENTS connects to DOUCHE via D4

Now, let's create the navigation plan from CELLIER to CH. PARENTS:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the CELLIER to the CH. PARENTS using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours. The plan starts by exiting the CELLIER through D2 into the CUISINE, then proceeds directly to CH. PARENTS through D3.
