Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the room and door connections, then provide a navigation plan from the GARAGE to CHAMBRE 2.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
D2: Connects HALL to WC
D3: Connects HALL to BAINS
D4: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 2
D6: Connects HALL to PORCHE
D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE
D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. ApproachDoor(9)
2. OpenDoor(9)
3. GoThrough(9)
4. ApproachDoor(1)
5. OpenDoor(1)
6. GoThrough(1)
7. ApproachDoor(5)
8. OpenDoor(5)
9. GoThrough(5)

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "GARAGE",
  "end": "CHAMBRE 2",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 9},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently guide you from the GARAGE to CHAMBRE 2 using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
