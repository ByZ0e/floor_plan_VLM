Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan to get from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to the CUISINE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. TERRASSE COUVERTE <-> D1 <-> CUISINE
2. CUISINE <-> D2 <-> CELLIER
3. CUISINE <-> D3 <-> CH. PARENTS
4. CH. PARENTS <-> D4 <-> DOUCHE

Navigation Plan:
To go from TERRASSE COUVERTE to CUISINE, we only need to use one door (D1). Here's the detailed plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "TERRASSE COUVERTE",
  "end": "CUISINE",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to the CUISINE using the shortest possible path. No unnecessary doors or rooms are included in this navigation.
