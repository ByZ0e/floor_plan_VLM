Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms and doors, create a list of connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to the CUISINE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. TERRASSE COUVERTE <-> D1 <-> CUISINE
2. CUISINE <-> D2 <-> CELLIER
3. CUISINE <-> D3 <-> CH. PARENTS
4. CH. PARENTS <-> D4 <-> DOUCHE

Now, for the navigation plan from TERRASSE COUVERTE to CUISINE:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to the CUISINE using the most direct path available. You'll approach Door 1 (D1), open it, and go through it to enter the CUISINE. No other doors need to be used for this particular navigation task.
