Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from CH. PARENTS to TERRASSE COUVERTE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CH. PARENTS connects to CUISINE via D3
2. CUISINE connects to CELLIER via D2
3. CELLIER connects to another CUISINE area via D2
4. The larger CUISINE area connects to TERRASSE COUVERTE via D1
5. DOUCHE is connected to CH. PARENTS via D4 (but not needed for this route)

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 2
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 2
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 2
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from CH. PARENTS to TERRASSE COUVERTE using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
