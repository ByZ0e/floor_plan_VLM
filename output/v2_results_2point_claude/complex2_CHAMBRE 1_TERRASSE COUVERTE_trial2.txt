Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from CHAMBRE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
- D2: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to HALL
- D3: Connects HALL to BAINS
- D4: Connects HALL to WC
- D5: Connects HALL to PORCHE
- D6: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
- D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE
- D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
- D9: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER

Navigation Plan:
Based on these connections, here's the step-by-step navigation plan from CHAMBRE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from CHAMBRE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
