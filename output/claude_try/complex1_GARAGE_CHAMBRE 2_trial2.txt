Inspecting the floor plan, here's a clear list of all rooms and doors with their connections:

Rooms:
- GARAGE
- CELLIER (2 instances)
- CHAMBRE 1
- CHAMBRE 2
- BAINS
- WC
- CUISINE
- TERRASSE COUVERTE (2 instances)
- PORCHE
- Multiple HALL areas connecting rooms

Doors:
- D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
- D2: Connects WC to HALL
- D3: Connects a HALL to another HALL
- D4: Connects CHAMBRE 1 to HALL
- D5: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to HALL
- D6: Connects PORCHE to a HALL
- D7: Connects CUISINE to a HALL
- D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
- D9: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER

To navigate from the GARAGE to CHAMBRE 2, the correct path would be:

{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(D9)",
    "OpenDoor(D9)",
    "GoThrough(D9)",
    "ApproachDoor(D1)", 
    "OpenDoor(D1)",
    "GoThrough(D1)",
    "ApproachDoor(D5)",
    "OpenDoor(D5)",
    "GoThrough(D5)"
  ]
}

This path avoids any unnecessary doors or rooms and follows the most direct route from the starting point (GARAGE) to the destination (CHAMBRE 2).
