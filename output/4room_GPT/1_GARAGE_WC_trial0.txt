### Navigation Plan

Starting in the Garage and aiming to reach the WC, the sequence of actions is as follows:

```json
[
  {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
  {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
  {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"},
  {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
  {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
  {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
  {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
  {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
  {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"}
]
```

This plan ensures that you move from the Garage to the WC by passing through the necessary doors in the correct sequence.
