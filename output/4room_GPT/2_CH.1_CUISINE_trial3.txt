```json
[
  {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
  {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
  {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
  {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
  {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
  {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
  {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
  {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
