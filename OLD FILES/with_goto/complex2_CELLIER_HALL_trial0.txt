### Navigation Plan

Starting in the CELLIER and arriving at the HALL, the sequence of actions is as follows:

```json
[
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoTo", "location": "HALL"}
]
```

This plan ensures that you move from the CELLIER to the HALL by approaching, opening, and going through the necessary door (D1) without involving any unnecessary doors or rooms.
