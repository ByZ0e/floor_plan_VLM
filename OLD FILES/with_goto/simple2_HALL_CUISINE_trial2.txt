### Rooms and Doors:
- **Rooms:**
  - HALL
  - CH.1
  - CH.2
  - BAIN
  - GARAGE
  - CUISINE

- **Doors:**
  - D1: Connects HALL and BAIN
  - D2: Connects HALL and CH.1
  - D3: Connects HALL and CH.2
  - D4: Connects HALL and GARAGE
  - D5: Connects HALL and CUISINE

### Navigation Plan:
```json
[
  {"action": "GoTo", "location": "HALL"},
  {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
  {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
  {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
