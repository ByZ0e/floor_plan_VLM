Here is the list of rooms and doors with their connections:

Rooms:
- CH.1

- CUISINE

Doors:
- D1: Connects CH.3 and SEJOUR

- D3: Connects CH.2 and SEJOUR
- D4: Connects CH.1 and SEJOUR
- D5: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE

To navigate from CH.1 to CH.2, the following sequence of actions is required:

```json
[
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoTo", "location": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoTo", "location": "CH.2"}
]
```

This plan ensures that you move from CH.1 to CH.2 by passing through the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
