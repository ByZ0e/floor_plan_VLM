## TODO

Dataset names:

	fully labeled
	ablation 1 (one label per room)
	ablation 2 (original door symbols + multiple labels per room)
	ablation 3 (original door symbols + 1 label per room)



More difficult task:

1. Harder maps (more rooms)
2. Dotted lines (add GOTO)
3. More complex task (A->B->C->D)
4. 





No GOTO command, no dotted lines
1. crop, rename ablation 1
2. crop, add labels, rename ablation 2
3. Log results (manually label correctness and plan length)
4. Report results (avg accuracy and avg plan length)
5. make figures
6. Repeat steps 3-5 for ablations
7. write paper



Dashed rooms:

1. added dotted lines to complex maps
2. Add new "rooms" for complex maps
3. Make new prompt for complex maps
4. Add to room list for pre-defined plans
