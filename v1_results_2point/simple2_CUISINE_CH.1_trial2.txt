Certainly! I'll start by providing a clear list of rooms and doors with their connections based on the floor plan image, and then I'll create a detailed navigation plan for you to move from the CUISINE to CH.1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D5, and to GARAGE via D4
2. GARAGE: Connected to CUISINE via D4
3. HALL: Central area connecting multiple rooms
4. BAINS: Connected to HALL via D1
5. CH.1: Connected to HALL via D2
6. CH.2: Connected to HALL via D3

Now, let's create the navigation plan:

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CUISINE
2. Use D5 to enter the HALL
3. From HALL, use D2 to enter CH.1

Here's the detailed action plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D5"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D5"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D5"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D2"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D2"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D2"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the CUISINE to CH.1, using only the necessary doors (D5 and D2) and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors. The robot will start in the CUISINE, go through D5 to enter the HALL, and then use D2 to reach the final destination, CH.1.
