Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and their door connections, then provide the navigation plan to get from BAINS to PORCHE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. BAINS: Connected to HALL via D4
2. CHAMBRE 3: Connected to HALL via D5
3. CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL via D6
4. CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D2
5. GARAGE: Connected to HALL via D1
6. CELLIER: Connected to HALL via D7
7. PORCHE: Connected to HALL via D8
8. HALL: Central area connecting all rooms

Navigation Plan:
To go from BAINS to PORCHE, we need to go through the HALL. Here's the step-by-step plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently take you from BAINS to PORCHE using only the necessary doors. You'll exit BAINS through D4 into the HALL, then go through D8 to reach the PORCHE. This is the most direct route based on the floor plan provided.
