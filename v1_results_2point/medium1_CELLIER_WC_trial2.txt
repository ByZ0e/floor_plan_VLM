Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the CELLIER to the WC.

Rooms and Doors:
- CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE via D2
- CUISINE: Connected to CELLIER via D2, to SEJOUR via D3
- SEJOUR: Connected to CUISINE via D3, to DEGT via D4
- DEGT: Connected to SEJOUR via D4, to WC via D8

Navigation Plan:
To get from the CELLIER to the WC, we need to pass through the CUISINE, SEJOUR, and DEGT. Here's the step-by-step plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the CELLIER to the WC using only the necessary doors and rooms along the path.
