Certainly! Let's start by listing out the rooms and doors with their connections based on the floor plan image:

Rooms:
1. CUISINE (multiple areas)
2. CELLIER
3. TERRASSE COUVERTE
4. CH. PARENTS
5. DOUCHE

Doors:
D1: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
D2: Connects CUISINE to CELLIER
D3: Connects CUISINE to CH. PARENTS
D4: Connects CH. PARENTS to DOUCHE

Now, let's create the navigation plan to go from CUISINE to DOUCHE:

Step-by-step solution:
1. We start in the CUISINE.
2. We need to go through D3 to reach CH. PARENTS.
3. From CH. PARENTS, we go through D4 to reach DOUCHE.

Here's the detailed action plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 4
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from CUISINE to DOUCHE, using only the necessary doors (D3 and D4) and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors. The robot will start in CUISINE, go through D3 to enter CH. PARENTS, and then through D4 to reach the final destination, DOUCHE.
