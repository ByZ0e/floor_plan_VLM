Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the HALL to the CUISINE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. HALL connects to CH.1 via D2
2. HALL connects to CH.2 via D3
3. HALL connects to BAINS via D1
4. HALL connects to GARAGE via D4
5. HALL connects to CUISINE via D5

Now, for the navigation plan from HALL to CUISINE:

The most efficient path from HALL to CUISINE is to use door D5. Here's the step-by-step plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 5
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 5
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 5
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan takes you directly from the HALL to the CUISINE using the most efficient route. No other doors need to be used for this navigation task.
