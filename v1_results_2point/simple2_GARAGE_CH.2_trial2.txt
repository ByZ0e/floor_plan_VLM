Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the GARAGE to CH.2.

Room and Door Connections:
1. GARAGE connects to CUISINE via D4
2. CUISINE connects to HALL via D5
3. HALL connects to CH.2 via D3
4. HALL connects to CH.1 via D2
5. HALL connects to BAINS via D1

Based on this analysis, here's the efficient navigation plan from GARAGE to CH.2:

```json
{
  "start": "GARAGE",
  "end": "CH.2",
  "actions": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently guides you from the GARAGE to CH.2 using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours. The path goes through the CUISINE and HALL before reaching CH.2, using doors D4, D5, and D3 in that order.
