Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
- CH.1 is connected to SEJOUR through D4
- CH.2 is connected to SEJOUR through D3
- CH.3 is connected to SEJOUR through D1 and D2
- CUISINE is connected to SEJOUR through D5 and D6

Now, for the navigation task from CH.1 to CH.2:

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CH.1
2. Use D4 to enter SEJOUR
3. Cross SEJOUR
4. Use D3 to enter CH.2

Here's the action plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from CH.1 to CH.2 using only the necessary doors (D4 and D3) and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
