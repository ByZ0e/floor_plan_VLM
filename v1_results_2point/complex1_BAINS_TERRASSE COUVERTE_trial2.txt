Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and their door connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the BAINS to the TERRASSE COUVERTE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. BAINS: D2
2. WC: D3
3. CHAMBRE 1: D4
4. CHAMBRE 2: D5
5. CELLIER: D1, D9
6. GARAGE: D9
7. CUISINE: D7, D8
8. TERRASSE COUVERTE: D8
9. PORCHE: D6
10. HALL: Connects to D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7

Navigation Plan:
To get from BAINS to TERRASSE COUVERTE, we need to go through the HALL and CUISINE. Here's the step-by-step plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the BAINS to the TERRASSE COUVERTE using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
