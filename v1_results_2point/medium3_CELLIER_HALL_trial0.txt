Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the CELLIER to the HALL.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE via D3
2. CUISINE: Connected to CELLIER via D3, to HALL via D6
3. GARAGES: Connected to HALL via D1
4. DOUCHE: Connected to HALL via D2
5. WC: Connected to HALL via D4
6. CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D5
7. HALL: Connected to multiple rooms via D1, D2, D4, D5, D6, D7

Navigation Plan:
To navigate from the CELLIER to the HALL, we need to go through the CUISINE. Here's the detailed plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D3"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D3"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D3"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D6"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D6"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D6"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the CELLIER to the HALL using only the necessary doors. The path goes through the CUISINE, which is the most direct route to reach the HALL from your starting point in the CELLIER.
