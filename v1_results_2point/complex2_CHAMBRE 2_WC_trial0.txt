Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and their door connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from CHAMBRE 2 to WC.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL via D2
2. HALL: Connected to CHAMBRE 2 (D2), PORCHE (D5), CUISINE (D7), WC (D4)
3. WC: Connected to HALL via D4

Now, let's create the navigation plan:

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CHAMBRE 2
2. Use D2 to enter the HALL
3. In the HALL, approach D4
4. Use D4 to enter the WC

JSON format navigation plan:
```json
{
  "start": "CHAMBRE 2",
  "end": "WC",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from CHAMBRE 2 to WC, using only the necessary doors (D2 and D4) and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
