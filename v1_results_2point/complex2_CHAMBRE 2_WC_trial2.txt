Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and their connected doors, then provide a navigation plan to get from CHAMBRE 2 to WC.

Room and Door Connections:
- CHAMBRE 2: D2, D5
- HALL (central): D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7
- WC: D4
- PORCHE: D5
- CUISINE: D7, D8
- CHAMBRE 1: D6
- CELLIER: D1, D9
- GARAGE: D9
- TERRASSE COUVERTE: D8

Navigation Plan:
To go from CHAMBRE 2 to WC, we need to exit CHAMBRE 2 and enter the central HALL, then access the WC. Here's the step-by-step plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CHAMBRE 2 to WC using only the necessary doors (D2 and D4) and avoiding any unnecessary detours or rooms.
