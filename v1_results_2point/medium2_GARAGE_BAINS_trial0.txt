Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the GARAGE to the BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
1. GARAGE - D1 - HALL
2. HALL - D2 - CHAMBRE 1
3. HALL - D3 - WC
4. HALL - D4 - BAINS
5. HALL - D5 - CHAMBRE 3
6. HALL - D6 - CHAMBRE 2
7. HALL - D7 - CELLIER
8. HALL - D8 - Porche

Navigation Plan:
To get from the GARAGE to the BAINS, we need to go through the HALL. Here's the efficient path:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the GARAGE to the BAINS using only the necessary doors. The path goes through the HALL, which connects both the GARAGE and the BAINS. No unnecessary rooms or doors are included in this plan.
