Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the WC to CHAMBRE 2.

Room and Door Connections:
1. WC connects to HALL through D3
2. HALL connects to:
   - CHAMBRE 1 through D2
   - CHAMBRE 3 through D5
   - CHAMBRE 2 through D6
   - CELLIER through D7
3. GARAGE connects to CELLIER through D1
4. CELLIER connects to Porche through D8
5. BAINS connects to HALL through D4

Based on this analysis, here's the efficient navigation plan from WC to CHAMBRE 2:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6}
  ]
}
```

This plan takes you directly from the WC to CHAMBRE 2 using only the necessary doors. The path avoids any unnecessary rooms or doors, providing an efficient route to your destination.
