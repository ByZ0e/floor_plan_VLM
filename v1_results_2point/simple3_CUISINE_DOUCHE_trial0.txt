Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first describe the rooms and doors, then provide the navigation plan.

Room and Door Descriptions:
- CUISINE: Connected to TERRASSE COUVERTE via D1, to CELLIER via D2
- TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE via D1
- CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE via D2
- CH. PARENTS: Connected to CUISINE via D3
- DOUCHE: Connected to CUISINE via D4

Now, for the navigation plan from CUISINE to DOUCHE:

The path is straightforward as there's a direct connection between CUISINE and DOUCHE through door D4.

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CUISINE",
  "end": "DOUCHE",
  "steps": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates you from the CUISINE to the DOUCHE using the most direct path available.
