Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide the navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CELLIER - connects to GARAGE via D9
2. CELLIER - connects to HALL via D1
3. CHAMBRE 2 - connects to HALL via D2
4. BAINS - connects to HALL via D3
5. WC - connects to HALL via D4
6. CHAMBRE 1 - connects to HALL via D6
7. PORCHE - connects to HALL via D5
8. CUISINE - connects to HALL via D7
9. TERRASSE COUVERTE - connects to CUISINE via D8

Based on these connections, here's the navigation plan from CELLIER to HALL:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"}
  ]
}
```

This is the most efficient path from CELLIER to HALL. You only need to use one door (D1) which directly connects CELLIER to HALL. There's no need to go through any other rooms or doors.
