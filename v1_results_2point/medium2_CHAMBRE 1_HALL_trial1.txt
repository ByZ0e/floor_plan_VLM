Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout and provide you with the necessary information and navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
- CHAMBRE 1 connects to HALL through D2
- HALL connects to CELLIER through D7
- HALL connects to Porche through D8

Now, let's create the navigation plan from CHAMBRE 1 to HALL:

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CHAMBRE 1
2. Approach door D2
3. Open door D2
4. Go through door D2 to enter HALL

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CHAMBRE 1",
  "end": "HALL",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"}
  ]
}
```

This is the most efficient path from CHAMBRE 1 to HALL, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours. The plan takes you directly from CHAMBRE 1 to HALL through door D2, which is the only door you need to use for this particular navigation task.
