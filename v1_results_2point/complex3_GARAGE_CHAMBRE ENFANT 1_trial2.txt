Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the GARAGE to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. GARAGE - D1 - CELLIER
2. CELLIER - D2 - PORCHE
3. PORCHE - D3 - HALL
4. HALL - D4 - WC
5. HALL - D5 - LINGERIE
6. HALL - D6 - BUREAU
7. HALL - D7 - BAINS
8. HALL - D8 - CHAMBRE PARENTS
9. HALL - D9 - CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
10. HALL - D10 - CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
11. CELLIER - D11 - HALL

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan from GARAGE to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 11},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 10}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates you from the GARAGE to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 using the necessary doors. The path goes through the CELLIER and main HALL before reaching the destination. This is the most direct route based on the floor plan provided.
