Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan.

Rooms and Door Connections:
1. CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE via D2
2. CUISINE: Connected to CELLIER via D2, to SEJOUR via D3
3. SEJOUR: Connected to CUISINE via D3, to DEGT via D4
4. DEGT: Connected to SEJOUR via D4, to CH.2 via D6, to WC via D8
5. CH.1: Connected to SEJOUR via D5
6. CH.2: Connected to DEGT via D6
7. WC: Connected to DEGT via D8
8. BAINS: Connected to DEGT via D7

Now, for the navigation plan from CELLIER to WC:

{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8}
  ]
}

This path takes you from the CELLIER through the CUISINE and SEJOUR, into the DEGT, and finally to the WC. It's the most direct route based on the floor plan provided.
