Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the CELLIER to CH. PARENTS.

Rooms and Doors:
1. CELLIER - connected to CUISINE via D2
2. CUISINE - connected to CELLIER via D2, TERRASSE COUVERTE via D1, and main CUISINE area via D3
3. TERRASSE COUVERTE - connected to CUISINE via D1
4. Main CUISINE area - connected to smaller CUISINE via D3 and CH. PARENTS via D4
5. CH. PARENTS - connected to main CUISINE area via D4
6. DOUCHE - connected to CH. PARENTS (no door between them)

Navigation Plan:
To get from CELLIER to CH. PARENTS, we need to go through the following doors in order: D2, D3, and D4.

Here's the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 2
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 2
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 2
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 4
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the CELLIER to CH. PARENTS using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
