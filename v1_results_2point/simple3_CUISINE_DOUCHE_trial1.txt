Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
- CUISINE (main area) connects to TERRASSE COUVERTE via D1
- CUISINE (main area) connects to CELLIER via D2
- CUISINE (main area) connects to CH. PARENTS via D3
- CH. PARENTS connects to DOUCHE via D4

Now, for the navigation plan from CUISINE to DOUCHE:

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in the CUISINE (main area)
2. Approach and go through D3 to enter CH. PARENTS
3. In CH. PARENTS, approach and go through D4 to reach DOUCHE

Here's the action plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from the CUISINE to the DOUCHE, using only the necessary doors (D3 and D4) and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
