Certainly! I'll provide you with a detailed navigation plan based on the floor plan image you've shared. First, let's list out the rooms and doors with their connections:

Rooms and Doors:
- GARAGE: Connected to CUISINE via D4
- CUISINE: Connected to GARAGE via D4, connected to HALL via D5
- HALL: Connected to CUISINE via D5, connected to CH.1 via D2, connected to CH.2 via D3, connected to BAINS via D1
- CH.1: Connected to HALL via D2
- CH.2: Connected to HALL via D3
- BAINS: Connected to HALL via D1

Now, let's create the navigation plan to get from the GARAGE to CH.2:

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in GARAGE
2. Use D4 to enter CUISINE
3. Use D5 to enter HALL
4. Use D3 to enter CH.2

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D5"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D5"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D5"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D3"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D3"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D3"
    }
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan provides the most efficient path from the GARAGE to CH.2, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors. The plan strictly follows the sequence of actions required for navigation: ApproachDoor, OpenDoor, and GoThrough for each door that needs to be traversed.
