Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms, doors, and their connections, then provide you with a navigation plan from the PORCHE to the CUISINE.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

1. PORCHE is connected to HALL via D5
2. HALL is connected to CUISINE via D7
3. CUISINE is also connected to TERRASSE COUVERTE via D8

Now, let's create the navigation plan:

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in PORCHE
2. Use D5 to enter HALL
3. Use D7 to enter CUISINE

Here's the detailed action plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D5"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D5"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D5"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D7"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D7"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D7"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient path from the PORCHE to the CUISINE, using only the necessary doors (D5 and D7) and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
