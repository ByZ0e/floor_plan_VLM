Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan to get from the PORCHE to the CUISINE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. PORCHE - D5 - HALL
2. HALL - D2 - CHAMBRE 2
3. HALL - D3 - BAINS
4. HALL - D4 - WC
5. HALL - D6 - CHAMBRE 1
6. HALL - D7 - CUISINE
7. CUISINE - D8 - TERRASSE COUVERTE
8. GARAGE - D9 - CELLIER
9. CELLIER - D1 - HALL

Navigation Plan:
To get from the PORCHE to the CUISINE, we need to go through the HALL. Here's the step-by-step plan:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the PORCHE to the CUISINE using only the necessary doors. The robot will start in the PORCHE, go through door D5 to enter the HALL, and then use door D7 to reach the CUISINE.
