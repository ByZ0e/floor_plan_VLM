Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the GARAGE to the BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
1. GARAGE - connected to CHAMBRE 1 via D1
2. CHAMBRE 1 - connected to HALL via D2
3. HALL - connected to WC via D3, BAINS via D4, CHAMBRE 3 via D5, CHAMBRE 2 via D6, CELLIER via D7, and Porche via D8

Now, let's create the navigation plan:

{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the GARAGE to the BAINS using the following steps:
1. Exit the GARAGE through D1 into CHAMBRE 1
2. Exit CHAMBRE 1 through D2 into the HALL
3. From the HALL, enter the BAINS through D4

This is the most direct and efficient path based on the floor plan provided, using only the necessary doors to reach the destination.
