Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the SEJOUR to the CUISINE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. SEJOUR: Connected to CH.1 via D4, CH.2 via D3, and CUISINE via D5
2. CH.1: Connected to SEJOUR via D4
3. CH.2: Connected to SEJOUR via D3, and CH.3 via D2
4. CH.3: Connected to CH.2 via D2, and another SEJOUR via D1
5. CUISINE: Connected to SEJOUR via D5

For this navigation task, we only need to use one door (D5) to go from SEJOUR to CUISINE.

Navigation Plan:
Here's the step-by-step plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "SEJOUR",
  "end": "CUISINE",
  "plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 5
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 5
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 5
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the SEJOUR to the CUISINE using the most direct path available.
