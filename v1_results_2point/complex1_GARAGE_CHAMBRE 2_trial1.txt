Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the GARAGE to CHAMBRE 2.

Room and Door Connections:
1. GARAGE - D9 - CELLIER
2. CELLIER - D1 - HALL
3. HALL - D2 - BAINS
4. HALL - D3 - WC
5. HALL - D4 - CHAMBRE 1
6. HALL - D5 - CHAMBRE 2
7. HALL - D6 - PORCHE
8. HALL - D7 - CUISINE
9. CUISINE - D8 - TERRASSE COUVERTE

Navigation Plan:
To go from the GARAGE to CHAMBRE 2, we need to pass through the CELLIER and the HALL. Here's the sequence of actions:

1. ApproachDoor(D9)
2. OpenDoor(D9)
3. GoThrough(D9)
4. ApproachDoor(D1)
5. OpenDoor(D1)
6. GoThrough(D1)
7. ApproachDoor(D5)
8. OpenDoor(D5)
9. GoThrough(D5)

Here's the path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"}
  ]
}
```

This path takes you from the GARAGE through the CELLIER and HALL to reach CHAMBRE 2 efficiently, using only the necessary doors along the way.
