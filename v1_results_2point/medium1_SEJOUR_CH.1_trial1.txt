Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from SEJOUR to CH.1.

Room and Door Connections:
- SEJOUR connects to CUISINE through D1 and D3
- SEJOUR connects to DEGT through D4
- DEGT connects to CH.1 through D5

Navigation Plan:
To get from SEJOUR to CH.1, we need to go through DEGT. Here's the step-by-step plan:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from SEJOUR to CH.1 using only the necessary doors. The robot will start in SEJOUR, go through D4 to enter DEGT, and then through D5 to reach CH.1. This is the most direct and correct path based on the floor plan provided.
