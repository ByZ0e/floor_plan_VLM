Certainly! I'll provide you with a detailed navigation plan based on the floor plan image. First, let's list out the rooms and doors with their connections:

Rooms and Doors:
1. GARAGE - connected to CELLIER via D9
2. CELLIER - connected to GARAGE via D9, to HALL via D1
3. HALL - connected to CELLIER via D1, to CHAMBRE 2 via D2, to BAINS via D3, to WC via D4
4. CHAMBRE 2 - connected to HALL via D2
5. BAINS - connected to HALL via D3
6. WC - connected to HALL via D4
7. PORCHE - connected to HALL via D5
8. CHAMBRE 1 - connected to HALL via D6
9. CUISINE - connected to HALL via D7, to TERRASSE COUVERTE via D8

Now, let's create the navigation plan to go from the GARAGE to the BAINS:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan will efficiently guide you from the GARAGE to the BAINS using only the necessary doors. The plan avoids any unnecessary rooms or doors, providing a direct path to your destination.
