Certainly! I'll provide you with a detailed navigation plan based on the floor plan image. Let's start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections:

Rooms:
- SEJOUR (living room)
- CUISINE (kitchen)
- CELLIER (pantry)
- DEGT (likely "dégagement" or hallway)
- BAINS (bathroom)
- WC (toilet)
- CH.1 (bedroom 1)
- CH.2 (bedroom 2)

Doors:
D1: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
D2: Connects CUISINE to CELLIER
D3: Connects CUISINE to SEJOUR
D4: Connects SEJOUR to DEGT
D5: Connects DEGT to CH.1
D6: Connects DEGT to CH.2
D7: Connects DEGT to BAINS
D8: Connects DEGT to WC

Now, let's create the navigation plan to go from SEJOUR to CH.1:

{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5}
  ]
}

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the SEJOUR to CH.1 using the following steps:
1. Approach door D4 (connecting SEJOUR to DEGT)
2. Open door D4
3. Go through door D4 to enter DEGT
4. Approach door D5 (connecting DEGT to CH.1)
5. Open door D5
6. Go through door D5 to enter CH.1

This is the most direct and efficient path to reach CH.1 from SEJOUR, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
