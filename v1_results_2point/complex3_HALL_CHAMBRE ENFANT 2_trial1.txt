Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2.

Room and Door Connections:
1. HALL connects to LINGERIE via D5
2. HALL connects to BUREAU via D6
3. HALL connects to BAINS via D7
4. HALL connects to CHAMBRE PARENTS via D8
5. HALL connects to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 via D10
6. HALL connects to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2 via D9

Now, let's create the navigation plan to get from the HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2:

{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 9}
  ]
}

This plan provides the most direct and efficient path from the HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2. You'll approach door D9, which connects the HALL directly to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2, open it, and go through it to reach your destination. No other doors or rooms need to be traversed for this particular route.
