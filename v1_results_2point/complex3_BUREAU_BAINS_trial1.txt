Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the BUREAU to the BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
1. BUREAU - D6 - HALL
2. HALL - D7 - BAINS

Navigation Plan:

To navigate from the BUREAU to the BAINS, we need to go through two doors: D6 and D7. Here's the step-by-step plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "BUREAU",
  "end": "BAINS",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently guide you from the BUREAU to the BAINS using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
