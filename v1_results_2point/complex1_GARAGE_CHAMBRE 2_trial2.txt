Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and their door connections, then provide the navigation plan from the GARAGE to CHAMBRE 2.

Room and Door Connections:
1. GARAGE - D9 connects to CELLIER
2. CELLIER - D1 connects to HALL
3. HALL - Multiple connections:
   - D1 to CELLIER
   - D2 to WC
   - D3 to BAINS
   - D4 to CHAMBRE 1
   - D5 to CHAMBRE 2
   - D6 to PORCHE
   - D7 to CUISINE
4. WC - D2 connects to HALL
5. BAINS - D3 connects to HALL
6. CHAMBRE 1 - D4 connects to HALL
7. CHAMBRE 2 - D5 connects to HALL
8. PORCHE - D6 connects to HALL
9. CUISINE - D7 connects to HALL
10. TERRASSE COUVERTE - D8 connects to CUISINE

Now, for the navigation plan from GARAGE to CHAMBRE 2:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates you from the GARAGE to CHAMBRE 2 using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors. The path goes through the CELLIER and HALL before reaching the final destination.
