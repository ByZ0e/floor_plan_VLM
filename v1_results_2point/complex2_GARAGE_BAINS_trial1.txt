Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the GARAGE to BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
1. GARAGE - D9 - CELLIER
2. CELLIER - D1 - HALL (near CHAMBRE 2)
3. CHAMBRE 2 - D2 - HALL
4. HALL - D3 - BAINS
5. HALL - D4 - WC
6. HALL - D5 - PORCHE
7. HALL - D6 - CHAMBRE 1
7. HALL - D7 - CUISINE
8. CUISINE - D8 - TERRASSE COUVERTE

Navigation Plan:
To get from the GARAGE to BAINS, we need to go through the following sequence:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 9},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the GARAGE to BAINS using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
