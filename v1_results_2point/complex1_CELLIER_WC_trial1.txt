Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan to get from the CELLIER to the WC.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CELLIER connects to HALL via D1
2. HALL connects to WC via D3
3. HALL connects to BAINS via D2
4. HALL connects to CHAMBRE 1 via D4
5. HALL connects to CHAMBRE 2 via D5
6. HALL connects to PORCHE via D6
7. HALL connects to CUISINE via D7
8. CUISINE connects to TERRASSE COUVERTE via D8
9. CELLIER connects to GARAGE via D9

Navigation Plan:
To go from the CELLIER to the WC, we need to use two doors: D1 and D3. Here's the step-by-step plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D3"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D3"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D3"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the CELLIER to the WC using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
