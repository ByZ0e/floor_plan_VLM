I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections based on the floor plan:

Rooms and Doors:
- DEGT connects to SEJOUR via D4 and to CH.2 via D6
- SEJOUR connects to CUISINE via D3
- CUISINE connects to CELLIER via D2
- CELLIER connects to PORCHE via D1

Now, let's create the navigation plan from DEGT to PORCHE:

1. Start in DEGT
2. Go through D4 to enter SEJOUR
3. Cross SEJOUR to D3
4. Go through D3 to enter CUISINE
5. Cross CUISINE to D2
6. Go through D2 to enter CELLIER
7. Cross CELLIER to D1
8. Go through D1 to reach PORCHE

Here's the detailed action plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D3"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D3"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D3"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D2"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D2"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D2"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D1"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from DEGT to PORCHE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
