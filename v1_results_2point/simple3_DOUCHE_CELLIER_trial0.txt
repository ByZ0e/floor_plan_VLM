Thank you for providing the floor plan. Let me first list out the rooms and doors with their connections based on the image:

Rooms:
1. DOUCHE
2. CH. PARENTS
3. CUISINE (multiple areas labeled as CUISINE)
4. TERRASSE COUVERTE
5. CELLIER

Doors:
D1: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE to CUISINE
D2: Connects CUISINE to CELLIER
D3: Connects CUISINE to CH. PARENTS
D4: Connects CH. PARENTS to DOUCHE

Now, for the navigation task from DOUCHE to CELLIER, here's the detailed plan:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the DOUCHE to the CELLIER using the following route:
DOUCHE -> D4 -> CH. PARENTS -> D3 -> CUISINE -> D2 -> CELLIER

This is the most direct and efficient path based on the floor plan provided, using only the necessary doors to reach the destination.
