Thank you for providing the floor plan. Let me first list out the rooms and doors with their connections based on the image:

Rooms and Door Connections:
1. CH.2 - Connected to SEJOUR via D3
2. CH.3 - Connected to SEJOUR via D1 and D2
3. CH.1 - Connected to SEJOUR via D4
4. SEJOUR - Central area connected to CH.2 (D3), CH.3 (D1, D2), CH.1 (D4), CUISINE (D5, D6)
5. CUISINE - Connected to SEJOUR via D5 and D6

Now, for the navigation task from CH.2 to SEJOUR, here's the detailed plan:

```json
{
  "start": "CH.2",
  "end": "SEJOUR",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

Explanation of the plan:
1. Starting in CH.2, we approach Door 3 (D3), which directly connects CH.2 to SEJOUR.
2. We open Door 3.
3. We go through Door 3 to enter SEJOUR, completing the navigation task.

This is the most efficient path as it requires using only one door (D3) to move directly from CH.2 to SEJOUR. No other doors or rooms need to be traversed for this particular navigation task.
