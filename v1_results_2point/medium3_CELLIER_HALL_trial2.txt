Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the CELLIER to the HALL.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CELLIER - D3 - CUISINE
2. CUISINE - D6 - HALL
3. HALL - D5 - CHAMBRE 1
4. HALL - D4 - WC
5. HALL - D2 - DOUCHE
6. HALL - D1 - GARAGES
7. CUISINE - D7 - HALL

For this navigation task, we need to go from CELLIER to HALL. Here's the efficient path:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6}
  ]
}
```

This path takes you from the CELLIER through the CUISINE and directly into the HALL, using only the necessary doors D3 and D6. It's the most efficient route based on the floor plan provided.
