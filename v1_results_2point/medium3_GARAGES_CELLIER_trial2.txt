Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the GARAGES to the CELLIER.

Room and Door Connections:
1. GARAGES connects to CELLIER via D1
2. CELLIER connects to CUISINE via D3
3. CUISINE connects to HALL via D6
4. HALL connects to WC via D4
5. HALL connects to DOUCHE via D2
6. HALL connects to CHAMBRE 1 via D5
7. HALL connects to another CUISINE via D7

Now, for the navigation plan from GARAGES to CELLIER:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the GARAGES to the CELLIER using the most direct route available based on the floor plan provided.
