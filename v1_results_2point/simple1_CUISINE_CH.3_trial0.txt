Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CUISINE: Connected to SEJOUR via D5
2. SEJOUR: Connected to CH.1 via D4, to CH.2 via D3, and to CH.3 via D2
3. CH.1: Connected to SEJOUR via D4
4. CH.2: Connected to SEJOUR via D3
5. CH.3: Connected to SEJOUR via D2 and to another SEJOUR area via D1

Now, for the navigation plan from CUISINE to CH.3:

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CUISINE
2. Use D5 to enter SEJOUR
3. Cross SEJOUR
4. Use D2 to enter CH.3

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from the CUISINE to CH.3, using only the necessary doors (D5 and D2) and avoiding any unnecessary detours through other rooms or doors.
