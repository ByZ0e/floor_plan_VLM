Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the SEJOUR to the CUISINE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. SEJOUR: Connected to CH.1 via D4, CH.2 via D3, CH.3 via D2, and CUISINE via D6
2. CH.1: Connected to SEJOUR via D4
3. CH.2: Connected to SEJOUR via D3
4. CH.3: Connected to SEJOUR via D2 and D1 (D1 connects two parts of CH.3)
5. CUISINE: Connected to SEJOUR via D6 and D5

Navigation Plan:
To go from SEJOUR to CUISINE, we only need to use one door: D6.

Here's the step-by-step navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 6
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 6
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 6
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently guide you from the SEJOUR to the CUISINE using the most direct path available according to the floor plan.
