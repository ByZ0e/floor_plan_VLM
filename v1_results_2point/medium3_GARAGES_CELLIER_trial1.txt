Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the GARAGES to the CELLIER.

Room and Door Connections:
1. GARAGES - D1 - CELLIER
2. GARAGES - D2 - HALL (adjacent to DOUCHE)
3. CELLIER - D3 - CUISINE
4. HALL (adjacent to DOUCHE) - D4 - HALL (adjacent to WC)
5. HALL (adjacent to WC) - D5 - CHAMBRE 1
6. HALL (adjacent to WC) - D6 - CUISINE
7. HALL (lower) - D7 - CUISINE

For the navigation task from GARAGES to CELLIER, we only need to use one door: D1. Here's the efficient navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "GARAGES",
  "end": "CELLIER",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from the GARAGES to the CELLIER using only the necessary door (D1) that connects these two spaces directly.
