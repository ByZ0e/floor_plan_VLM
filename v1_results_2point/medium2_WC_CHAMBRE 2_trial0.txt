Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and their door connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the WC to CHAMBRE 2.

Room and Door Connections:
1. WC: Connected to HALL via D3
2. HALL: Connected to CHAMBRE 1 via D2, CHAMBRE 2 via D6, CHAMBRE 3 via D5, CELLIER via D7, and Porche via D8
3. BAINS: Connected to HALL via D4
4. CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D2
5. CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL via D6
6. CHAMBRE 3: Connected to HALL via D5
7. CELLIER: Connected to HALL via D7
8. GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER via D1
9. Porche: Connected to HALL via D8

Navigation Plan:
To go from WC to CHAMBRE 2, we need to:
1. Exit WC to HALL
2. From HALL, enter CHAMBRE 2

Here's the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "doorNumber": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "doorNumber": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "doorNumber": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "doorNumber": 6
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "doorNumber": 6
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "doorNumber": 6
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the WC to CHAMBRE 2 using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
