Certainly! I'll start by providing a list of rooms and doors with their connections based on the floor plan image, and then I'll give you the navigation plan to go from CHAMBRE PARENTS to CELLIER.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CHAMBRE PARENTS: Connected to HALL via D8
2. BAINS: Connected to HALL via D7
3. BUREAU: Connected to HALL via D6
4. LINGERIE: Connected to HALL via D5
5. WC: Connected to HALL via D4
6. HALL: Connected to PORCHE via D3
7. PORCHE: Connected to CELLIER via D2
8. CELLIER: Connected to GARAGE via D1
9. CHAMBRE ENFANT 2: Connected to HALL via D9
10. CHAMBRE ENFANT 1: Connected to HALL via D10
11. CELLIER (lower): Connected to HALL via D11

Now, let's create the navigation plan from CHAMBRE PARENTS to CELLIER:

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CHAMBRE PARENTS
2. Use D8 to enter HALL
3. Move through HALL
4. Use D3 to enter PORCHE
5. Use D2 to reach CELLIER

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2}
  ]
}
```

This path takes you from CHAMBRE PARENTS to CELLIER using the most direct route available based on the door connections in the floor plan. The plan avoids unnecessary doors and rooms, ensuring an efficient path to your destination.
