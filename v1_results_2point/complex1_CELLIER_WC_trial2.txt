Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CELLIER:
   - D1: Connects to HALL
   - D9: Connects to GARAGE
2. HALL:
   - D1: Connects to CELLIER
   - D2: Connects to BAINS
   - D3: Connects to WC
   - D4: Connects to CHAMBRE 1
   - D5: Connects to CHAMBRE 2
   - D6: Connects to PORCHE
   - D7: Connects to CUISINE
3. WC:
   - D3: Connects to HALL
4. BAINS:
   - D2: Connects to HALL
5. CHAMBRE 1:
   - D4: Connects to HALL
6. CHAMBRE 2:
   - D5: Connects to HALL
7. GARAGE:
   - D9: Connects to CELLIER
8. PORCHE:
   - D6: Connects to HALL
9. CUISINE:
   - D7: Connects to HALL
10. TERRASSE COUVERTE:
    - D8: Connects to CUISINE

Now, for the navigation plan from CELLIER to WC:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the CELLIER to the WC using only the necessary doors. It starts in the CELLIER, goes through door D1 to enter the HALL, and then uses door D3 to reach the WC.
