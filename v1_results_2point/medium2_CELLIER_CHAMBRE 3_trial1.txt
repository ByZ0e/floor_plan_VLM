First, let's outline the rooms and doors with their connections based on the floor plan:

Rooms and Door Connections:
- CELLIER: Connected to HALL via D7
- HALL: Connected to CHAMBRE 1 via D2, CHAMBRE 2 via D6, and Porche via D8
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D2
- CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL via D6
- CHAMBRE 3: Connected to HALL via D5
- BAINS: Connected to HALL via D4

Now, let's create the navigation plan from CELLIER to CHAMBRE 3:

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CELLIER
2. Use D7 to enter HALL
3. From HALL, use D5 to enter CHAMBRE 3

Here's the efficient navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from CELLIER to CHAMBRE 3, using only the necessary doors (D7 and D5) and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
