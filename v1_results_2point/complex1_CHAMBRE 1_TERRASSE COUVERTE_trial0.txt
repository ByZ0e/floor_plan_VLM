I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections based on the floor plan, then provide the navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CHAMBRE 1 - D4 - HALL
2. HALL - D5 - HALL (central area)
3. HALL (central area) - D7 - CUISINE
4. CUISINE - D8 - TERRASSE COUVERTE

Navigation Plan:
To go from CHAMBRE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE, we need to pass through the following doors in order: D4, D5, D7, and D8.

Here's the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from CHAMBRE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
