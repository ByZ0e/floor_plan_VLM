Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan to get from CHAMBRE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CHAMBRE 1 - D4 - HALL
2. HALL - D5 - HALL (central area)
3. HALL (central area) - D7 - CUISINE
4. CUISINE - D8 - TERRASSE COUVERTE

Navigation Plan:
To get from CHAMBRE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE, we need to go through the central HALL area, then through the CUISINE. Here's the step-by-step plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CHAMBRE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
