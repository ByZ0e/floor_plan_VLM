Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2.

Room and Door Connections:
1. HALL connects to LINGERIE via D5
2. HALL connects to BUREAU via D6
3. HALL connects to BAINS via D7
4. HALL connects to CHAMBRE PARENTS via D8
5. HALL connects to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2 via D9
6. HALL connects to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 via D10

Based on this analysis, here's the efficient navigation plan from HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 9
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 9
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 9
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct route from the HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2 using only the necessary door (D9). The robot starts in the HALL, approaches door D9, opens it, and goes through to reach CHAMBRE ENFANT 2. No other doors or rooms need to be traversed for this particular navigation task.
