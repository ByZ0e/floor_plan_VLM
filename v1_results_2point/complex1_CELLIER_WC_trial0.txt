I'll start by explicitly listing the rooms and doors with their connections based on the floor plan image:

Rooms and Door Connections:
1. CELLIER: Connected to HALL via D1, and to GARAGE via D9
2. GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER via D9
3. HALL: Connected to CELLIER via D1, WC via D3, BAINS via D2, CHAMBRE 1 via D4, CHAMBRE 2 via D5, PORCHE via D6, and CUISINE via D7
4. WC: Connected to HALL via D3
5. BAINS: Connected to HALL via D2
6. CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D4
7. CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL via D5
8. PORCHE: Connected to HALL via D6
9. CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D7, and TERRASSE COUVERTE via D8
10. TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE via D8

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan to go from CELLIER to WC:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the CELLIER to the WC using only the necessary doors. The robot starts in the CELLIER, goes through D1 to enter the HALL, and then through D3 to reach the WC. No unnecessary doors or rooms are included in this path.
