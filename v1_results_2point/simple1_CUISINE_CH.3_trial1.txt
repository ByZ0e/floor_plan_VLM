Certainly! I'll analyze the floor plan, provide a list of rooms and doors with their connections, and then give you a detailed navigation plan to go from the CUISINE to CH.3.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CUISINE: Connected to SEJOUR via D5
2. SEJOUR: Connected to CUISINE via D5, to CH.1 via D4, to CH.2 via D3, and to another SEJOUR area via D6
3. CH.1: Connected to SEJOUR via D4
4. CH.2: Connected to SEJOUR via D3, and to CH.3 via D2
5. CH.3: Connected to CH.2 via D2, and to another SEJOUR area via D1

Now, let's create the navigation plan:

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CUISINE
2. Go through D5 to enter SEJOUR
3. Cross SEJOUR to reach D3
4. Go through D3 to enter CH.2
5. Cross CH.2 to reach D2
6. Go through D2 to enter CH.3

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2}
  ]
}
```

This path takes you from the CUISINE to CH.3 using the most direct route available based on the floor plan provided. It avoids unnecessary doors and rooms, ensuring an efficient navigation plan.
