Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from CHAMBRE 1 to GARAGES.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CHAMBRE 1 - D5 - HALL
2. HALL - D2 - DOUCHE
3. HALL - D4 - WC
4. HALL - D6 - CUISINE
5. CUISINE - D3 - CELLIER
6. CELLIER - D1 - GARAGES

Now, let's create the navigation plan:

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CHAMBRE 1
2. Use D5 to enter the HALL
3. Cross the HALL to D6
4. Use D6 to enter the CUISINE
5. Cross the CUISINE to D3
6. Use D3 to enter the CELLIER
7. Cross the CELLIER to D1
8. Use D1 to reach the GARAGES

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This path efficiently navigates from CHAMBRE 1 to GARAGES using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
