Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan to get from CHAMBRE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CHAMBRE 1 connects to HALL via D4
2. HALL connects to:
   - CHAMBRE 1 via D4
   - WC via D3
   - BAINS via D2
   - CELLIER via D1
   - CHAMBRE 2 via D5
   - PORCHE via D6
   - CUISINE via D7
3. CUISINE connects to:
   - HALL via D7
   - TERRASSE COUVERTE via D8
4. TERRASSE COUVERTE is accessible from CUISINE via D8
5. CELLIER connects to GARAGE via D9

Navigation Plan:
To go from CHAMBRE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE, we need to pass through the HALL and CUISINE. Here's the step-by-step plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CHAMBRE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or paths.
