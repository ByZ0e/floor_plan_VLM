Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan to get from the CELLIER to the HALL.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CELLIER - connected to GARAGE via D9
2. CELLIER - connected to HALL via D1
3. CHAMBRE 2 - connected to HALL via D2
4. BAINS - connected to HALL via D3
5. WC - connected to HALL via D4
6. PORCHE - connected to HALL via D5
7. CHAMBRE 1 - connected to HALL via D6
7. CUISINE - connected to HALL via D7
8. TERRASSE COUVERTE - connected to CUISINE via D8

Navigation Plan:
To go from CELLIER to HALL, we only need to use one door: D1. Here's the action sequence in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"}
  ]
}
```

This is the most efficient path from the CELLIER to the HALL, using only the necessary door D1. No other doors or rooms need to be traversed for this particular navigation task.
