Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the CELLIER to CH. PARENTS.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CELLIER - connected to CUISINE via D2
2. CUISINE - connected to TERRASSE COUVERTE via D1
3. CUISINE - connected to another part of CUISINE via D3
4. CUISINE - connected to DOUCHE via D4
5. DOUCHE - connected to CH. PARENTS (no door, open passage)

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan to go from CELLIER to CH. PARENTS:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the CELLIER to CH. PARENTS using the necessary doors. After going through D4, you'll be in the DOUCHE, which has an open passage to CH. PARENTS, so no additional door actions are needed for the final step.
