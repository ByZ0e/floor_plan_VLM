Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan from CH.1 to the GARAGE.

Rooms and Doors:
1. CH.1: Connected to HALL via D2
2. CH.2: Connected to HALL via D3
3. BAINS: Connected to HALL via D1
4. GARAGE: Connected to HALL via D4
5. CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D4 and D5
6. HALL: Central area connecting all rooms

Door Connections:
- D1: Connects BAINS to HALL
- D2: Connects CH.1 to HALL
- D3: Connects CH.2 to HALL
- D4: Connects GARAGE to HALL
- D5: Connects CUISINE to HALL

Navigation Plan from CH.1 to GARAGE:
To reach the GARAGE from CH.1, we need to go through the HALL. Here's the step-by-step plan:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CH.1 to the GARAGE using only the necessary doors (D2 and D4) and passing through the HALL as required. It avoids any unnecessary detours or unused doors.
