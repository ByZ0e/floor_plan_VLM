Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the connections between rooms and doors, then provide a navigation plan from the PORCHE to the LINGERIE.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

1. PORCHE connects to CELLIER through D2
2. CELLIER connects to HALL through D3
3. HALL connects to WC through D4
4. HALL connects to LINGERIE through D5

Now, I'll create a navigation plan based on these connections:

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in PORCHE
2. Use D2 to enter CELLIER
3. Use D3 to enter HALL
4. Use D5 to reach LINGERIE

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the PORCHE to the LINGERIE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
