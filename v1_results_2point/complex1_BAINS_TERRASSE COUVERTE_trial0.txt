I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections based on the floor plan image:

Rooms and Doors:
1. BAINS: Connected to HALL via D2
2. WC: Connected to HALL via D3
3. CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D4
4. CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL via D5
5. CELLIER: Connected to HALL via D1, connected to GARAGE via D9
6. GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER via D9
7. PORCHE: Connected to HALL via D6
8. CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D7
9. TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to HALL via D8

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan to go from BAINS to TERRASSE COUVERTE:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from BAINS to TERRASSE COUVERTE using only the necessary doors. The robot will exit the BAINS through D2, enter the HALL, and then go directly to the TERRASSE COUVERTE through D8. This avoids any unnecessary rooms or doors along the way.
