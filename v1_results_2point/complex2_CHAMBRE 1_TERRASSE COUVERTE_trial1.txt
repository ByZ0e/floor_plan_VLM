Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan to get from CHAMBRE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CHAMBRE 1 - D6 - HALL
2. HALL - D4 - WC
3. HALL - D3 - BAINS
4. HALL - D2 - CHAMBRE 2
5. HALL - D7 - CUISINE
6. CUISINE - D8 - TERRASSE COUVERTE
7. CUISINE - D5 - PORCHE
8. CHAMBRE 2 - D1 - CELLIER
9. GARAGE - D9 - CELLIER

Navigation Plan:
To go from CHAMBRE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE, we need to use the following doors: D6, D7, and D8.

Here's the step-by-step navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently guide you from CHAMBRE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
