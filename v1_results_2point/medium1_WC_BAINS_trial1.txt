Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide the navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
- WC is connected to DEGT via D8
- DEGT is connected to CH.2 via D6
- DEGT is connected to SEJOUR via D4
- SEJOUR is connected to CUISINE via D3
- CUISINE is connected to CELLIER via D2
- BAINS is connected to DEGT via D7

Now, for the navigation plan from WC to BAINS:

1. ApproachDoor(8)
2. OpenDoor(8)
3. GoThrough(8)
4. ApproachDoor(7)
5. OpenDoor(7)
6. GoThrough(7)

Here's the plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient path from the WC to the BAINS, using only the necessary doors (D8 and D7) that are part of the path being used. The robot will start in the WC, go through D8 to enter the DEGT area, and then use D7 to reach the BAINS.
