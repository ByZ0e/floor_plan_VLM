Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan from the PORCHE to the CUISINE.

Room and Door Connections:
- PORCHE: D5 connects to HALL
- HALL: D5 connects to PORCHE, D2 connects to CHAMBRE 2, D7 connects to CUISINE
- CHAMBRE 2: D2 connects to HALL
- CUISINE: D7 connects to HALL, D8 connects to TERRASSE COUVERTE

Navigation Plan:
To go from the PORCHE to the CUISINE, we need to use two doors: D5 and D7. Here's the step-by-step plan:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently take you from the PORCHE to the CUISINE using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
