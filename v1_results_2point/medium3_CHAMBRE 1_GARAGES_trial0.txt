Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a detailed navigation plan from CHAMBRE 1 to GARAGES.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CHAMBRE 1 - D5 - HALL
2. HALL - D2 - DOUCHE
3. HALL - D4 - WC
4. HALL - D6 - CUISINE
5. CUISINE - D3 - CELLIER
6. CELLIER - D1 - GARAGES
7. CUISINE - D7 - HALL (lower part of the floor plan)

Now, let's create the navigation plan from CHAMBRE 1 to GARAGES:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan provides the most efficient path from CHAMBRE 1 to GARAGES, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours. The plan takes you through the HALL, CUISINE, and CELLIER before reaching the GARAGES.
