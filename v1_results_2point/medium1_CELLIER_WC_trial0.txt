Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CELLIER - connected to CUISINE via D2
2. CUISINE - connected to SEJOUR via D3
3. SEJOUR - connected to DEGT via D4
4. DEGT - connected to CH.2 via D6 and to WC/BAINS area via D7

Now, let's create the navigation plan from CELLIER to WC:

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CELLIER
2. Use D2 to enter CUISINE
3. Use D3 to enter SEJOUR
4. Use D4 to enter DEGT
5. Use D7 to reach WC

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D2"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D2"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D2"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D3"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D3"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D3"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D7"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D7"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D7"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from the CELLIER to the WC, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
