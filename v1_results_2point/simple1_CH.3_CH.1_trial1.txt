Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan from CH.3 to CH.1.

Room and Door Connections:
- CH.3 connects to SEJOUR through D1
- CH.2 connects to SEJOUR through D2 and D3
- CH.1 connects to SEJOUR through D4
- CUISINE connects to SEJOUR through D5 and D6

To navigate from CH.3 to CH.1, we need to go through the SEJOUR. Here's the step-by-step navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D4"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates you from CH.3 to CH.1 using only the necessary doors (D1 and D4) and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
