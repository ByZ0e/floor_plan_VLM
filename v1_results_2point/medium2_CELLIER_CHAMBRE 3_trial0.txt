Certainly! I'll analyze the floor plan, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a detailed navigation plan for you to move from the CELLIER to CHAMBRE 3.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CELLIER: Connected to HALL via D7
2. HALL: Connected to CHAMBRE 1 via D2, CHAMBRE 2 via D6, BAINS via D4, and Porche via D8
3. CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D2
4. CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL via D6
5. BAINS: Connected to HALL via D4
6. CHAMBRE 3: Connected to BAINS (no direct door, must go through BAINS)
7. GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER via D1 (not needed for this route)
8. Porche: Connected to HALL via D8 (not needed for this route)

Now, let's create the navigation plan to get from CELLIER to CHAMBRE 3:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently guide you from the CELLIER to CHAMBRE 3:

1. You start in the CELLIER.
2. Approach and go through D7 to enter the HALL.
3. In the HALL, approach and go through D4 to enter BAINS.
4. Once in BAINS, you have reached your destination as CHAMBRE 3 is directly connected to BAINS without a separate door.

This is the most direct and efficient route based on the floor plan provided. It avoids unnecessary rooms and uses only the required doors to reach the destination.
