Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the GARAGE to CH.2.

Rooms and Doors:
1. GARAGE: Connected to CUISINE via D4
2. CUISINE: Connected to GARAGE via D4, to HALL via D5
3. HALL: Connected to CUISINE via D5, to CH.1 via D2, to CH.2 via D3, to BAINS via D1
4. CH.1: Connected to HALL via D2
5. CH.2: Connected to HALL via D3
6. BAINS: Connected to HALL via D1

Navigation Plan:
To go from GARAGE to CH.2, we need to pass through the CUISINE and HALL. Here's the step-by-step plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the GARAGE to CH.2 using only the necessary doors and rooms.
