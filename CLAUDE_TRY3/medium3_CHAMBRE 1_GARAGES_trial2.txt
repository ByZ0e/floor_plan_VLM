Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
- CHAMBRE 1 connects to HALL via D5
- HALL connects to WC via D4
- HALL connects to DOUCHE via D2
- HALL connects to CUISINE via D6
- CUISINE connects to CELLIER via D3
- CELLIER connects to GARAGES via D1

Now, for the navigation plan from CHAMBRE 1 to GARAGES:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"}
  ]
}
```

This path takes you from CHAMBRE 1 through the HALL, into the CUISINE, then through the CELLIER, and finally into the GARAGES. It uses only the necessary doors (D5, D6, D3, and D1) to reach the destination efficiently without any unnecessary detours.
