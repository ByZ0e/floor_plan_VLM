Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing out the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide the navigation plan to get from the CELLIER to the HALL.

Room and Door Connections:
- CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE via D3
- CUISINE: Connected to CELLIER via D3, to HALL via D6
- WC: Connected to HALL via D4
- DOUCHE: Connected to HALL via D2
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D5
- GARAGES: Connected to CELLIER via D1

Navigation Plan:
To get from the CELLIER to the HALL, we need to go through the CUISINE. Here's the detailed plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the CELLIER to the HALL using the necessary doors D3 and D6. The plan avoids any unnecessary detours through other rooms or doors.
