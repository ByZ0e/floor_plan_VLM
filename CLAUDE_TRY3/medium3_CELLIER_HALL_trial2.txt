First, let me describe the rooms and doors as seen in the floor plan:

Rooms:
- GARAGES (large space at the top)
- CELLIER (two spaces)
- CUISINE
- CHAMBRE 1 (three spaces)
- DOUCHE (two spaces)
- WC
- HALL (multiple spaces)

Doors:
- D1: Between GARAGES and CELLIER
- D2: Between HALL and DOUCHE
- D3: Between CELLIER and HALL/WC area
- D4: Between WC and HALL
- D5: Between HALL and CHAMBRE 1
- D6: Between HALL and CUISINE
- D7: Between CUISINE and HALL

Now, for the navigation plan from CELLIER to HALL:

The most efficient path is to use door D3, which directly connects CELLIER to the HALL area. Here's the detailed plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D3"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D3"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D3"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CELLIER to HALL using only the necessary door (D3) without passing through any unnecessary rooms or doors.
