Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide the navigation plan to get from the GARAGES to the CELLIER.

Rooms and Doors:
- GARAGES: Connected to CELLIER via D1
- CELLIER: Connected to GARAGES via D1, to CUISINE via D3
- CUISINE: Connected to CELLIER via D3, to HALL via D6
- WC: Connected to HALL via D4
- DOUCHE: Connected to HALL via D2
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D5
- HALL: Central area connecting multiple rooms

Now, for the navigation plan from GARAGES to CELLIER:

The path is straightforward as these two rooms are directly connected by door D1. Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the GARAGES to the CELLIER using the most direct route available.
