Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing out the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide the navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
- CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE via D3
- CUISINE: Connected to CELLIER via D3, to HALL via D6
- GARAGES: Connected to HALL via D1
- WC: Connected to HALL via D4
- DOUCHE: Connected to HALL via D2
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D5
- HALL: Central area connecting multiple rooms

Navigation Plan:
To go from CELLIER to HALL, we need to go through the CUISINE. Here's the sequence of actions:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently take you from the CELLIER to the HALL using only the necessary doors (D3 and D6) and passing through the CUISINE. The plan avoids any unnecessary detours or extra rooms, providing a direct path to your destination.
