Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan from CHAMBRE 1 to GARAGES.

Room and Door Connections:
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D5
- HALL: Central area connecting multiple rooms
- DOUCHE: Connected to HALL via D2
- WC: Connected to HALL via D4
- CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D6 and D7
- CELLIER: Connected to HALL via D3, and to GARAGES via D1
- GARAGES: Large area accessible from CELLIER via D1

Navigation Plan:
To go from CHAMBRE 1 to GARAGES, we need to follow this path:
CHAMBRE 1 -> HALL -> CELLIER -> GARAGES

Here's the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates you from CHAMBRE 1 to GARAGES using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
