[

    "action": "ApproachDoor",
    "door": "D5"
  },
  {
    "action": "OpenDoor", 
    "door": "D5"
  },
  {
    "action": "GoThrough",
    "door": "D5"
  },
  {
    "action": "ApproachDoor",
    "door": "D1"
  },
  {
    "action": "OpenDoor",
    "door": "D1" 
  },
  {
    "action": "GoThrough",
    "door": "D1"
  }
]
```

The plan has you start in CHAMBRE 1, go through door D5 into the HALL, approach and open door D1, then go through D1 to arrive in the GARAGES, using the most direct route while avoiding unnecessary rooms and doors.
