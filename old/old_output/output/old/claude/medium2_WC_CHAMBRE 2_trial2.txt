Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the WC to CHAMBRE 2.

Room and Door Connections:
1. WC: Connected to HALL via D3
2. BAINS: Connected to HALL via D4
3. CHAMBRE 3: Connected to HALL via D5
4. CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL via D6
5. CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D2
6. CELLIER: Connected to HALL via D7
7. GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER via D1
8. HALL: Connected to Porche via D8

Navigation Plan:
To go from the WC to CHAMBRE 2, we need to exit the WC into the HALL and then enter CHAMBRE 2. Here's the detailed plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the WC to CHAMBRE 2 using only the necessary doors. It avoids any unnecessary rooms or doors, providing a direct path to the destination.
