Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2.

Room and Door Connections:
1. HALL connects to LINGERIE via D5
2. HALL connects to BUREAU via D6
3. HALL connects to BAINS via D7
4. HALL connects to CHAMBRE PARENTS via D8
5. HALL connects to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2 via D9
6. HALL connects to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 via D10

Based on this analysis, here's the efficient navigation plan to get from the HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 9}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from the HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2. You'll approach door D9, which connects the HALL directly to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2, open it, and go through to reach your destination.
