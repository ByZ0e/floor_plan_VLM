Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the WC to the CUISINE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. WC: Connected to HALL via D4
2. HALL: Connected to WC (D4), DOUCHE (D2), CHAMBRE 1 (D5), CUISINE (D6)
3. DOUCHE: Connected to HALL via D2
4. CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D5
5. CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D6, CELLIER via D3
6. CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE via D3, GARAGES via D1
7. GARAGES: Connected to CELLIER via D1

Now, let's create the navigation plan from WC to CUISINE:

```json
{
  "start": "WC",
  "end": "CUISINE",
  "actions": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan will efficiently guide you from the WC to the CUISINE using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours. The plan takes you through the HALL, which connects the WC to the CUISINE directly.
