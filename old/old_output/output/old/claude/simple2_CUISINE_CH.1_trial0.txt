Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout and provide you with the necessary information and navigation plan.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:
- CUISINE: Connected to HALL through D5, connected to GARAGE through D4
- GARAGE: Connected to CUISINE through D4
- HALL: Central area connecting multiple rooms
- BAINS: Connected to HALL through D1
- CH.2: Connected to HALL through D3
- CH.1: Connected to HALL through D2

Navigation Plan:
To navigate from CUISINE to CH.1, we'll need to use the following sequence of actions:

1. ApproachDoor(D5)
2. OpenDoor(D5)
3. GoThrough(D5)
4. ApproachDoor(D2)
5. OpenDoor(D2)
6. GoThrough(D2)

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CUISINE",
  "end": "CH.1",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently guide you from the CUISINE to CH.1 using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
