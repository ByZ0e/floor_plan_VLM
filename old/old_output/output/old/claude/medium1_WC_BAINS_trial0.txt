Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide the navigation plan from WC to BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
1. WC: Connected to DEGT via D8
2. DEGT: Connected to WC via D8, SEJOUR via D4, CH.2 via D6
3. SEJOUR: Connected to DEGT via D4, CUISINE via D3
4. CUISINE: Connected to SEJOUR via D3
5. BAINS: Connected to DEGT via D7
6. CH.1: Connected to SEJOUR via D5
7. CH.2: Connected to DEGT via D6

Navigation Plan:
To go from WC to BAINS, we need to go through DEGT. Here's the step-by-step plan:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently take you from the WC to the BAINS using only the necessary doors. You'll exit the WC through D8 into the DEGT area, and then immediately enter the BAINS through D7.
