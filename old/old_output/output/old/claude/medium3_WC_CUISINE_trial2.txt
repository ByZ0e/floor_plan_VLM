Thank you for providing the floor plan. Let's start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections based on the image:

Rooms and Door Connections:
1. WC connects to HALL through D4
2. HALL connects to DOUCHE through D2
3. HALL connects to CHAMBRE 1 through D5
4. HALL connects to CUISINE through D6
5. CUISINE connects to CELLIER through D3
6. CELLIER connects to GARAGES through D1
7. CUISINE connects to HALL (lower part) through D7

Now, let's create the navigation plan to go from the WC to the CUISINE:

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in WC
2. Use D4 to enter HALL
3. Use D6 to enter CUISINE

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 6
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 6
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 6
    }
  ]
}
```

This path is the most efficient route from the WC to the CUISINE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
