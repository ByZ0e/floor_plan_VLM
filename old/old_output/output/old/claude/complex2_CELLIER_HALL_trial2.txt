Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CELLIER - D1 - HALL
2. HALL - D2 - CHAMBRE 2
3. HALL - D3 - BAINS
4. HALL - D4 - WC
5. HALL - D5 - PORCHE
6. HALL - D6 - CHAMBRE 1
7. HALL - D7 - CUISINE
8. CUISINE - D8 - TERRASSE COUVERTE
9. GARAGE - D9 - CELLIER

For the navigation task to go from CELLIER to HALL, here's the step-by-step plan:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"}
  ]
}
```

This plan is the most efficient route from the CELLIER to the HALL. It involves using only one door (D1) which directly connects these two spaces. No other doors or rooms need to be traversed for this particular navigation task.
