Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan to get from BAINS to TERRASSE COUVERTE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. BAINS: connected to HALL via D2
2. WC: connected to HALL via D3
3. CHAMBRE 1: connected to HALL via D4
4. CHAMBRE 2: connected to HALL via D5
5. CELLIER: connected to HALL via D1
6. GARAGE: connected to CELLIER via D9
7. PORCHE: connected to HALL via D6
8. CUISINE: connected to HALL via D7
9. TERRASSE COUVERTE: connected to HALL via D8

Navigation Plan:
To go from BAINS to TERRASSE COUVERTE, we need to go through the HALL. Here's the step-by-step plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from BAINS to TERRASSE COUVERTE using only the necessary doors (D2 and D8) and avoiding any unnecessary detours or rooms.
