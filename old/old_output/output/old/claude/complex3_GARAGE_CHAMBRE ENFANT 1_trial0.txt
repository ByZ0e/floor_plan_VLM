Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the GARAGE to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1.

Rooms and Doors:
1. GARAGE connects to CELLIER via D1
2. CELLIER connects to HALL via D3
3. HALL connects to WC via D4
4. HALL connects to LINGERIE via D5
5. HALL connects to BUREAU via D6
6. HALL connects to BAINS via D7
7. HALL connects to CHAMBRE PARENTS via D8
8. HALL connects to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2 via D9
9. HALL connects to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 via D10

Based on this analysis, here's the efficient navigation plan from GARAGE to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 10}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct route from the GARAGE to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours. The robot will start in the GARAGE, move through the CELLIER, enter the main HALL area, and then directly access CHAMBRE ENFANT 1.
