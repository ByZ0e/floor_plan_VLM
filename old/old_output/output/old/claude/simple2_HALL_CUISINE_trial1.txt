Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the HALL to the CUISINE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. HALL connects to CH.1 via D2
2. HALL connects to CH.2 via D3
3. HALL connects to BAINS via D1
4. HALL connects to GARAGE via D4
5. HALL connects to CUISINE via D5

Now, let's create the navigation plan to go from HALL to CUISINE:

{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5}
  ]
}

This plan is the most efficient route from the HALL to the CUISINE. You start in the HALL, approach door D5, open it, and go through it to reach the CUISINE. No other doors or rooms need to be traversed for this particular navigation task.
