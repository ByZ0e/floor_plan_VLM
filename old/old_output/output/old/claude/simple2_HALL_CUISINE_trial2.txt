Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the HALL to the CUISINE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. HALL connects to CH.1 through D2
2. HALL connects to CH.2 through D3
3. HALL connects to BAINS through D1
4. HALL connects to GARAGE through D4
5. HALL connects to CUISINE through D5

Based on these connections, here's the navigation plan to get from the HALL to the CUISINE:

```json
{
  "start": "HALL",
  "end": "CUISINE",
  "actions": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 5
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 5
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 5
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from the HALL to the CUISINE using only the necessary doors. The robot will approach D5, open it, and go through to reach the CUISINE directly from the HALL.
