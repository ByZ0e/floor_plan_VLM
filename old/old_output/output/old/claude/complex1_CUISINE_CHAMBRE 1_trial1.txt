First, let's list out the rooms and doors with their connections based on the floor plan:

Rooms and Doors:
- CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D7
- HALL: Connected to CUISINE via D7, PORCHE via D6, CHAMBRE 2 via D5, CHAMBRE 1 via D4
- PORCHE: Connected to HALL via D6
- CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL via D5
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D4
- BAINS: Connected to HALL via D2
- WC: Connected to HALL via D3
- CELLIER: Connected to HALL via D1
- GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER via D9
- TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE via D8

Now, let's create the navigation plan from CUISINE to CHAMBRE 1:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the CUISINE to CHAMBRE 1 using only the necessary doors. It starts in the CUISINE, goes through D7 to enter the HALL, and then through D4 to reach CHAMBRE 1. No unnecessary doors or rooms are included in this path.
