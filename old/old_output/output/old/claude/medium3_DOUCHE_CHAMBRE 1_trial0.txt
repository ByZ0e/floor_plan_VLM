Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan to get from the DOUCHE to CHAMBRE 1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. DOUCHE: connected to HALL via D2
2. HALL: connected to WC via D4, CHAMBRE 1 via D5, and CUISINE via D6
3. CUISINE: connected to HALL via D6, and CELLIER via D3
4. CELLIER: connected to CUISINE via D3, and GARAGES via D1
5. GARAGES: connected to CELLIER via D1
6. WC: connected to HALL via D4
7. CHAMBRE 1: connected to HALL via D5

Now, for the navigation plan from DOUCHE to CHAMBRE 1:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the DOUCHE to CHAMBRE 1 using only the necessary doors. The path goes through the HALL, which connects these two rooms directly.
