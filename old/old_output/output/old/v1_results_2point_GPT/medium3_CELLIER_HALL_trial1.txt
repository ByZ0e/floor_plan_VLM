### Navigation Plan

To navigate from the CELLIER to the HALL, the most efficient path involves using Door D3 to go through the CUISINE and then Door D6 to enter the HALL.

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"}
  ]
}
```

This plan ensures that you move from the CELLIER to the HALL efficiently by passing through the CUISINE and using the necessary doors.
