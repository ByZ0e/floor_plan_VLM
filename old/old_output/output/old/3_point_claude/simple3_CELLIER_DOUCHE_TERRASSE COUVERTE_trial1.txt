Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
- CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE via D2
- CUISINE: Connected to CELLIER via D2, to TERRASSE COUVERTE via D1, and to CH. PARENTS via D3
- TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE via D1
- CH. PARENTS: Connected to CUISINE via D3, and to DOUCHE via D4
- DOUCHE: Connected to CH. PARENTS via D4

Now, for the navigation plan from CELLIER to DOUCHE to TERRASSE COUVERTE:

```json
{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(D2)",
    "OpenDoor(D2)",
    "GoThrough(D2)",
    "ApproachDoor(D3)",
    "OpenDoor(D3)",
    "GoThrough(D3)",
    "ApproachDoor(D4)",
    "OpenDoor(D4)",
    "GoThrough(D4)",
    "ApproachDoor(D4)",
    "OpenDoor(D4)",
    "GoThrough(D4)",
    "ApproachDoor(D3)",
    "OpenDoor(D3)",
    "GoThrough(D3)",
    "ApproachDoor(D1)",
    "OpenDoor(D1)",
    "GoThrough(D1)"
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the CELLIER to DOUCHE and then to TERRASSE COUVERTE using only the necessary doors. It avoids any unnecessary rooms or doors and accounts for doors closing after each GoThrough action.
