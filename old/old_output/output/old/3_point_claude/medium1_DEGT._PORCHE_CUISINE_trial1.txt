Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout and provide you with a detailed navigation plan as requested. First, let me list out the rooms and doors with their connections:

Rooms and their connections:
- DEGT: Connected to SEJOUR, CH.2, and BAINS via D4, D5, D6, D7, D8
- SEJOUR: Connected to DEGT (D4), CUISINE (D3), and PORCHE (D1)
- CUISINE: Connected to SEJOUR (D3) and CELLIER (D2)
- PORCHE: Connected to SEJOUR (D1)
- CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE (D2)
- CH.1: Connected to SEJOUR (D5)
- CH.2: Connected to DEGT (D6)
- BAINS: Connected to DEGT (D7)
- WC: Connected to DEGT (D8)

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan to go from DEGT to PORCHE, and then to CUISINE:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from DEGT to PORCHE and then to CUISINE using the necessary doors. The plan avoids any unnecessary rooms or doors, ensuring a direct path to your destination.
