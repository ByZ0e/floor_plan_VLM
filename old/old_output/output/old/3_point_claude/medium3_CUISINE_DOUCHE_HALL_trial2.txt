Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
- CUISINE: Connected to CELLIER via D6, and to HALL via D7
- CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE via D6, and to GARAGES via D1
- GARAGES: Connected to CELLIER via D1
- WC: Connected to HALL via D4
- DOUCHE: Connected to HALL via D2
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D5
- HALL: Central area connecting multiple rooms

Navigation Plan:
To go from CUISINE to DOUCHE and then to HALL, we'll use the following sequence:

1. Start in CUISINE
2. ApproachDoor(D7)
3. OpenDoor(D7)
4. GoThrough(D7)
5. ApproachDoor(D2)
6. OpenDoor(D2)
7. GoThrough(D2)
8. ApproachDoor(D2)
9. OpenDoor(D2)
10. GoThrough(D2)

Here's the plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    "ApproachDoor(D7)",
    "OpenDoor(D7)",
    "GoThrough(D7)",
    "ApproachDoor(D2)",
    "OpenDoor(D2)",
    "GoThrough(D2)",
    "ApproachDoor(D2)",
    "OpenDoor(D2)",
    "GoThrough(D2)"
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CUISINE to DOUCHE and then back to HALL, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
