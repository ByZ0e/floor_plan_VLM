First, let me list out the rooms and doors with their connections based on the floor plan:

Rooms and their connections:
- GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER via D9
- CELLIER: Connected to GARAGE via D9, to HALL via D1
- HALL: Central area connecting multiple rooms
- CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL via D5
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D4
- WC: Connected to HALL via D2
- BAINS: Connected to HALL (no door)
- CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D7
- PORCHE: Connected to HALL via D6
- TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE via D8

Doors:
D1: Between CELLIER and HALL
D2: Between WC and HALL
D3: Between WC and HALL (another entrance)
D4: Between CHAMBRE 1 and HALL
D5: Between CHAMBRE 2 and HALL
D6: Between PORCHE and HALL
D7: Between CUISINE and HALL
D8: Between CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Between GARAGE and CELLIER

Now, for the navigation plan from GARAGE to CHAMBRE 1, then to CHAMBRE 2:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"}
  ]
}
```

This path efficiently navigates from the GARAGE to CHAMBRE 1, and then to CHAMBRE 2, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
