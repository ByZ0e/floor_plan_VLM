Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors, and then provide you with an efficient navigation plan.

Rooms and Doors:
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D5
- HALL: Central area connecting multiple rooms
- CELLIER: Connected to HALL via D3
- CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D6 and D7
- DOUCHE: Connected to HALL via D2
- WC: Connected to HALL via D4
- GARAGES: Connected to CELLIER via D1

Now, let's create the navigation plan from CHAMBRE 1 to CELLIER:

{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(D5)",
    "OpenDoor(D5)",
    "GoThrough(D5)",
    "ApproachDoor(D3)",
    "OpenDoor(D3)",
    "GoThrough(D3)"
  ]
}

This plan efficiently guides you from CHAMBRE 1 to CELLIER using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours. The path takes you through the HALL, which connects the two rooms, using only the required doors D5 and D3.
