Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan as requested.

Rooms and Doors:
- CH. PARENTS: Connected to CUISINE via D3
- CUISINE: Large central area, connected to CH. PARENTS (D3), DOUCHE (D4), CELLIER (D2), and TERRASSE COUVERTE (D1)
- DOUCHE: Connected to CUISINE via D4
- CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE via D2
- TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE via D1

Now, for the navigation plan from CH. PARENTS to CUISINE to DOUCHE:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CH. PARENTS to CUISINE using D3, and then from CUISINE to DOUCHE using D4. It includes only the necessary doors that are part of the path being used and doesn't mention any doors that won't be traversed.
