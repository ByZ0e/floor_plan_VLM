Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
- CUISINE: Connected to CELLIER via D6, to HALL via D7
- CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE via D6, to GARAGES via D1, to WC via D3
- GARAGES: Connected to CELLIER via D1
- WC: Connected to CELLIER via D3, to HALL via D4
- DOUCHE: Connected to HALL via D2
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D5
- HALL: Central area connecting multiple rooms

Navigation Plan:
To go from CUISINE to DOUCHE and then to HALL, here's the efficient path:

1. Start in CUISINE
2. ApproachDoor(D7)
3. OpenDoor(D7)
4. GoThrough(D7)
5. ApproachDoor(D2)
6. OpenDoor(D2)
7. GoThrough(D2)
8. ApproachDoor(D2)
9. OpenDoor(D2)
10. GoThrough(D2)

Here's the plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CUISINE to DOUCHE and then back to HALL, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
