Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan as requested.

Rooms and Doors:
- CHAMBRE ENFANT 1: Connected to HALL via D10
- HALL: Central area connecting multiple rooms
- BAINS: Connected to HALL via D7
- CHAMBRE PARENTS: Connected to HALL via D8
- Other rooms (not directly relevant to this path): GARAGE, CELLIER, PORCHE, WC, LINGERIE, BUREAU, CHAMBRE ENFANT 2

Navigation Plan:
To go from CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 to BAINS, then to CHAMBRE PARENTS, we'll use the following sequence:

```json
{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(D10)",
    "OpenDoor(D10)",
    "GoThrough(D10)",
    "ApproachDoor(D7)",
    "OpenDoor(D7)",
    "GoThrough(D7)",
    "ApproachDoor(D7)",
    "OpenDoor(D7)",
    "GoThrough(D7)",
    "ApproachDoor(D8)",
    "OpenDoor(D8)",
    "GoThrough(D8)"
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 to BAINS and then to CHAMBRE PARENTS using only the necessary doors. It accounts for doors closing after each GoThrough action, ensuring that all required doors are opened when needed.
