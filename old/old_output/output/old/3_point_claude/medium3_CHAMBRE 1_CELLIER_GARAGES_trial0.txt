Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the connections and provide a navigation plan for you. First, let me list out the rooms and doors with their connections:

Rooms and Doors:
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D5
- HALL: Central area connecting multiple rooms
- CELLIER: Connected to HALL via D3
- GARAGES: Connected to HALL via D1
- CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D6 and D7
- DOUCHE: Connected to HALL via D2
- WC: Connected to HALL (no specific door, assumed to be always open)

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan from CHAMBRE 1 to CELLIER, and then to GARAGES:

{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"}
  ]
}

This plan efficiently navigates you from CHAMBRE 1 to CELLIER and then to GARAGES, using only the necessary doors along the path.
