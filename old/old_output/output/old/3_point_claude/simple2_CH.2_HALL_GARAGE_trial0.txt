Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout and provide you with a detailed navigation plan as requested. First, let me describe the rooms and doors for reference:

Rooms and their connections:
- CH.2 connects to HALL via D3
- HALL connects to GARAGE via D4
- GARAGE is a large room with no other internal doors

Doors:
D1: Connects BAINS to HALL
D2: Connects CH.1 to HALL
D3: Connects CH.2 to HALL
D4: Connects HALL to GARAGE
D5: Connects CUISINE to HALL

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan to go from CH.2 to GARAGE via HALL:

{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "target": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "target": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "target": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "target": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "target": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "target": "D4"}
  ]
}

This plan efficiently navigates you from CH.2 to GARAGE using only the necessary doors (D3 and D4) and passing through HALL as required. The plan avoids any unnecessary rooms or doors.
