Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan as requested.

Rooms and Doors:
- CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL via D2
- HALL: Central area connecting multiple rooms
- PORCHE: Connected to HALL via D5
- CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D7
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D6
- BAINS: Connected to HALL via D3
- WC: Connected to HALL via D4
- CELLIER: Connected to GARAGE via D9 and to HALL via D1
- GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER via D9
- TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE via D8

Now, for the navigation plan from CHAMBRE 2 to PORCHE:

{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(D2)",
    "OpenDoor(D2)",
    "GoThrough(D2)",
    "ApproachDoor(D5)",
    "OpenDoor(D5)",
    "GoThrough(D5)"
  ]
}

This plan efficiently navigates you from CHAMBRE 2 to PORCHE using only the necessary doors. You start in CHAMBRE 2, go through D2 to enter the HALL, and then use D5 to reach the PORCHE. The plan avoids any unnecessary rooms or doors, providing a direct path to your destination.
