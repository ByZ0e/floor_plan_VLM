Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
- DEGT: Connected to SEJOUR via D4, CH.2 via D6, and BAINS via D7
- SEJOUR: Connected to DEGT via D4, CUISINE via D3, and PORCHE via D1
- CUISINE: Connected to SEJOUR via D3 and CELLIER via D2
- PORCHE: Connected to SEJOUR via D1
- CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE via D2
- CH.1: Connected to SEJOUR via D5
- CH.2: Connected to DEGT via D6
- BAINS: Connected to DEGT via D7
- WC: Connected to BAINS via D8

Navigation Plan:
To go from DEGT to PORCHE and then to CUISINE, we need to use the following sequence of actions:

```json
{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(D4)",
    "OpenDoor(D4)",
    "GoThrough(D4)",
    "ApproachDoor(D1)",
    "OpenDoor(D1)",
    "GoThrough(D1)",
    "ApproachDoor(D1)",
    "OpenDoor(D1)",
    "GoThrough(D1)",
    "ApproachDoor(D3)",
    "OpenDoor(D3)",
    "GoThrough(D3)"
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from DEGT to PORCHE and then to CUISINE using the necessary doors without any unnecessary detours.
