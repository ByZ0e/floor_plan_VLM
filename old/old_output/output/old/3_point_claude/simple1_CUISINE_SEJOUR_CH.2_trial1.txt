First, let me describe the rooms and doors as I see them in the floor plan:

Rooms:
- CUISINE
- SEJOUR (multiple areas labeled as SEJOUR)
- CH.1
- CH.2
- CH.3

Doors:
- D1: Connects CH.3 to SEJOUR
- D2: Connects CH.3 to CH.2
- D3: Connects CH.2 to SEJOUR
- D4: Connects CH.1 to SEJOUR
- D5: Connects CUISINE to SEJOUR
- D6: Connects CUISINE to SEJOUR (another entrance)

Now, for the navigation plan from CUISINE to SEJOUR, then to CH.2:

The most efficient path would be:

1. Start in CUISINE
2. Use D5 to enter SEJOUR
3. From SEJOUR, use D3 to enter CH.2

Here's the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D5"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D5"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D5"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D3"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D3"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D3"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CUISINE to SEJOUR using D5, and then from SEJOUR to CH.2 using D3, fulfilling the requirements of the task.
