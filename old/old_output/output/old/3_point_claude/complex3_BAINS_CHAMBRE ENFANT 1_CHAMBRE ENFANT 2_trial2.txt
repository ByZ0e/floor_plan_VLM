First, let me list out the rooms and doors with their connections:

Rooms and their connections:
- BAINS: Connected to HALL via D7
- BUREAU: Connected to HALL via D6
- LINGERIE: Connected to HALL via D5
- WC: Connected to HALL via D4
- CELLIER: Connected to HALL via D3, D2, and D11
- GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER via D1
- CHAMBRE PARENTS: Connected to HALL via D8
- CHAMBRE ENFANT 1: Connected to HALL via D10
- CHAMBRE ENFANT 2: Connected to HALL via D9

Doors:
D1: Between GARAGE and CELLIER
D2, D3: Between CELLIER and HALL
D4: Between WC and HALL
D5: Between LINGERIE and HALL
D6: Between BUREAU and HALL
D7: Between BAINS and HALL
D8: Between CHAMBRE PARENTS and HALL
D9: Between CHAMBRE ENFANT 2 and HALL
D10: Between CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 and HALL
D11: Between CELLIER and HALL

Now, for the navigation plan from BAINS to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1, then to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from BAINS to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 and then to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2 using only the necessary doors. It avoids any unnecessary rooms or doors and provides the correct sequence of actions to complete the task.
