Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first describe the rooms and doors, then provide the navigation plan.

Rooms and Doors:
- TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE via D1
- CUISINE: Large central room, connected to TERRASSE COUVERTE (D1), CELLIER (D2), and CH. PARENTS (D3)
- CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE via D2
- CH. PARENTS: Connected to CUISINE via D3 and to DOUCHE via D4
- DOUCHE: Connected to CH. PARENTS via D4

Navigation Plan:
To go from TERRASSE COUVERTE to CH. PARENTS and then to CUISINE, the efficient path is:

1. Start in TERRASSE COUVERTE
2. Use D1 to enter CUISINE
3. Use D3 to enter CH. PARENTS
4. Use D3 again to return to CUISINE

Here's the plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D3"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D3"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D3"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D3"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D3"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D3"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan ensures you navigate efficiently from TERRASSE COUVERTE to CH. PARENTS and then back to CUISINE, using only the necessary doors along the path.
