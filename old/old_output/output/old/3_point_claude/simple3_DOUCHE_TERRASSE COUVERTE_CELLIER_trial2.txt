First, I'll list out the rooms and doors with their connections based on the floor plan:

Rooms:
1. DOUCHE
2. CH. PARENTS
3. CUISINE (large central area)
4. CELLIER
5. TERRASSE COUVERTE

Doors:
D1: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE to CUISINE
D2: Connects CUISINE to CELLIER
D3: Connects CUISINE to CH. PARENTS
D4: Connects CH. PARENTS to DOUCHE

Now, for the navigation plan from DOUCHE to TERRASSE COUVERTE to CELLIER:

```json
{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(D4)",
    "OpenDoor(D4)",
    "GoThrough(D4)",
    "ApproachDoor(D3)",
    "OpenDoor(D3)",
    "GoThrough(D3)",
    "ApproachDoor(D1)",
    "OpenDoor(D1)",
    "GoThrough(D1)",
    "ApproachDoor(D1)",
    "OpenDoor(D1)",
    "GoThrough(D1)",
    "ApproachDoor(D2)",
    "OpenDoor(D2)",
    "GoThrough(D2)"
  ]
}
```

This path takes you from DOUCHE to CH. PARENTS, then to the main CUISINE area, to TERRASSE COUVERTE, back to CUISINE, and finally to CELLIER. It uses all necessary doors and doesn't include any unnecessary rooms or doors in the path.
