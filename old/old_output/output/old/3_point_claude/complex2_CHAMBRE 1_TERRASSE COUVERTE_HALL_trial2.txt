Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide the navigation plan as requested.

Rooms and Doors:
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D6
- CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL via D2
- CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D7
- BAINS: Connected to HALL via D3
- WC: Connected to HALL via D4
- GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER via D9
- CELLIER: Connected to HALL via D1
- PORCHE: Connected to HALL via D5
- TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE via D8

Navigation Plan:
To go from CHAMBRE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE and then to HALL, here's the efficient path:

```json
{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(D6)",
    "OpenDoor(D6)",
    "GoThrough(D6)",
    "ApproachDoor(D7)",
    "OpenDoor(D7)",
    "GoThrough(D7)",
    "ApproachDoor(D8)",
    "OpenDoor(D8)",
    "GoThrough(D8)",
    "ApproachDoor(D8)",
    "OpenDoor(D8)",
    "GoThrough(D8)",
    "ApproachDoor(D7)",
    "OpenDoor(D7)",
    "GoThrough(D7)"
  ]
}
```

This path takes you from CHAMBRE 1 through the HALL, into the CUISINE, then to the TERRASSE COUVERTE, and finally back to the HALL as requested. The plan includes only the necessary doors that are part of the path being used and avoids any unnecessary rooms or doors.
