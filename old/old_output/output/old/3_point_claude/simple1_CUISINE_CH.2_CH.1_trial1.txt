Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
- CUISINE: Connected to SEJOUR via D5
- SEJOUR: Connected to CUISINE via D5, to CH.1 via D4, to CH.2 via D3, and to CH.3 via D2
- CH.1: Connected to SEJOUR via D4
- CH.2: Connected to SEJOUR via D3
- CH.3: Connected to SEJOUR via D2
- D1: Not used in this navigation plan
- D6: Not used in this navigation plan

Now, for the navigation plan from CUISINE to CH.2, then to CH.1:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the CUISINE to CH.2 and then to CH.1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
