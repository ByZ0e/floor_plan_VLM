Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide the navigation plan as requested.

Rooms and Doors:
- BAINS: Connected to HALL via D4
- WC: Connected to HALL via D3
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D2
- CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL via D6
- CHAMBRE 3: Connected to HALL via D5
- GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER via D1
- CELLIER: Connected to HALL via D7
- HALL: Central area connecting most rooms
- Porche: Connected to HALL via D8

Now, for the navigation plan from BAINS to CHAMBRE 2 to WC:

{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(D4)",
    "OpenDoor(D4)",
    "GoThrough(D4)",
    "ApproachDoor(D6)",
    "OpenDoor(D6)",
    "GoThrough(D6)",
    "ApproachDoor(D6)",
    "OpenDoor(D6)",
    "GoThrough(D6)",
    "ApproachDoor(D3)",
    "OpenDoor(D3)",
    "GoThrough(D3)"
  ]
}

This path efficiently navigates from BAINS to CHAMBRE 2 and then to WC, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
