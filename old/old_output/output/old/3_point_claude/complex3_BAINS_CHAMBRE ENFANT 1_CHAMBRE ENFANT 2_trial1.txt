First, let me describe the rooms and doors as shown in the floor plan:

Rooms:
- BAINS (Bathroom)
- BUREAU (Office)
- LINGERIE
- CHAMBRE PARENTS (Parents' Bedroom)
- CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 (Child's Bedroom 1)
- CHAMBRE ENFANT 2 (Child's Bedroom 2)
- GARAGE
- CELLIER (Cellar)
- WC
- PORCHE (Porch)
- Multiple HALL areas

Doors:
D1: Between GARAGE and CELLIER
D2: Between CELLIER and PORCHE
D3: Between PORCHE and HALL
D4: Between HALL and WC
D5: Between HALL and LINGERIE
D6: Between LINGERIE and BUREAU
D7: Between BUREAU and BAINS
D8: Between BAINS and CHAMBRE PARENTS
D9: Between HALL and CHAMBRE PARENTS
D10: Between HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
D11: Between HALL and CELLIER

Now, for the navigation plan from BAINS to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 and then to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2:

{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(D7)",
    "OpenDoor(D7)",
    "GoThrough(D7)",
    "ApproachDoor(D6)",
    "OpenDoor(D6)",
    "GoThrough(D6)",
    "ApproachDoor(D5)",
    "OpenDoor(D5)",
    "GoThrough(D5)",
    "ApproachDoor(D10)",
    "OpenDoor(D10)",
    "GoThrough(D10)",
    "ApproachDoor(D10)",
    "OpenDoor(D10)",
    "GoThrough(D10)",
    "ApproachDoor(D9)",
    "OpenDoor(D9)",
    "GoThrough(D9)"
  ]
}

This path takes you from BAINS through the BUREAU, LINGERIE, and HALL to reach CHAMBRE ENFANT 1, and then back through the HALL to reach CHAMBRE ENFANT 2. It's the most efficient route based on the floor plan provided.
