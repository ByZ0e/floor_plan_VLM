Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan as requested.

Rooms and Doors:
- GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER via D9
- CELLIER: Connected to GARAGE via D9, to HALL via D1
- CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL via D5
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D4
- BAINS: Connected to HALL via D2
- WC: Connected to HALL via D3
- CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D7
- PORCHE: Connected to HALL via D6
- TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE via D8

Navigation Plan:
To go from GARAGE to CHAMBRE 1 and then to CHAMBRE 2, here's the efficient path:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"}
  ]
}
```

This path efficiently navigates from the GARAGE to CHAMBRE 1 and then to CHAMBRE 2, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
