Certainly! I'll start by listing out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
- BAINS: Connected to HALL via D7
- HALL: Connected to BUREAU via D6, LINGERIE via D5, WC via D4, and CHAMBRE PARENTS via D8
- CHAMBRE ENFANT 1: Connected to HALL via D10
- CHAMBRE ENFANT 2: Connected to HALL via D9

Now, for the navigation plan from BAINS to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1, then to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from BAINS to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 and then to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2 using only the necessary doors. It starts in BAINS, goes through the HALL, enters CHAMBRE ENFANT 1, then returns to the HALL before finally entering CHAMBRE ENFANT 2.
