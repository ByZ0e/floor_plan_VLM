First, let me explicitly describe the rooms and doors based on the floor plan:

Rooms:
- GARAGE
- CELLIER (3 small rooms)
- CHAMBRE 1
- CHAMBRE 2
- CHAMBRE 3
- BAINS
- WC
- HALL (multiple connected areas)
- Porche

Doors:
D1: Connects GARAGE to HALL
D2: Connects CHAMBRE 1 to HALL
D3: Connects WC to HALL
D4: Connects BAINS to HALL
D5: Connects CHAMBRE 3 to HALL
D6: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to HALL
D7: Connects CELLIER to HALL
D8: Connects HALL to Porche

Now, for the navigation plan from HALL to CHAMBRE 1 to CHAMBRE 2:

1. We start in the HALL
2. To go to CHAMBRE 1, we need to use D2
3. To go from CHAMBRE 1 to CHAMBRE 2, we need to go back to the HALL through D2 and then use D6

Here's the detailed plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D2"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D2"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D2"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D2"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D2"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D2"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D6"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D6"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D6"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the HALL to CHAMBRE 1, then to CHAMBRE 2, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
