First, let me describe the rooms and doors based on the floor plan:

Rooms:
- CH.3
- CH.2
- CH.1
- SEJOUR (multiple areas labeled as such)
- CUISINE

Doors:
- D1: Connects CH.3 to the SEJOUR area
- D2: Connects CH.3 to CH.2
- D3: Connects CH.2 to the SEJOUR area
- D4: Connects CH.1 to the SEJOUR area
- D5: Connects CUISINE to the SEJOUR area
- D6: Another connection between CUISINE and SEJOUR

Now, for the navigation plan from CH.3 to CH.2 to CH.1:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CH.3 to CH.2 and then to CH.1 using the necessary doors without any unnecessary detours or room entries.
