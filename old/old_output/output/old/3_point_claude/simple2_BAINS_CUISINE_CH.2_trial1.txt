First, let me describe the rooms and doors as shown in the floor plan:

Rooms:
- BAINS (Bathroom)
- CH.1 (Bedroom 1)
- CH.2 (Bedroom 2)
- GARAGE
- CUISINE (Kitchen)
- Multiple HALL areas

Doors:
- D1: Connects BAINS to the upper HALL
- D2: Connects CH.1 to the upper HALL
- D3: Connects CH.2 to the middle HALL
- D4: Connects GARAGE to CUISINE
- D5: Connects CUISINE to the lower HALL

Now, for the navigation plan from BAINS to CUISINE to CH.2:

```json
{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(D1)",
    "OpenDoor(D1)",
    "GoThrough(D1)",
    "ApproachDoor(D5)",
    "OpenDoor(D5)",
    "GoThrough(D5)",
    "ApproachDoor(D5)",
    "OpenDoor(D5)",
    "GoThrough(D5)",
    "ApproachDoor(D3)",
    "OpenDoor(D3)",
    "GoThrough(D3)"
  ]
}
```

This path takes you from BAINS to CUISINE and then to CH.2 using the most direct route available through the doors shown on the floor plan.
