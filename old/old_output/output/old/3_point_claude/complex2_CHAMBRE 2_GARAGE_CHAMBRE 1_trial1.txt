Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan as requested.

Rooms and Doors:
- CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL via D2
- GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER via D9
- CELLIER: Connected to HALL via D1
- HALL: Central area connecting multiple rooms
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D6
- CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D7
- PORCHE: Connected to HALL via D5
- BAINS: Connected to HALL via D3
- WC: Connected to HALL via D4
- TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE via D8

Now, for the navigation plan from CHAMBRE 2 to GARAGE to CHAMBRE 1:

{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(D2)",
    "OpenDoor(D2)",
    "GoThrough(D2)",
    "ApproachDoor(D1)",
    "OpenDoor(D1)",
    "GoThrough(D1)",
    "ApproachDoor(D9)",
    "OpenDoor(D9)",
    "GoThrough(D9)",
    "ApproachDoor(D9)",
    "OpenDoor(D9)",
    "GoThrough(D9)",
    "ApproachDoor(D1)",
    "OpenDoor(D1)",
    "GoThrough(D1)",
    "ApproachDoor(D6)",
    "OpenDoor(D6)",
    "GoThrough(D6)"
  ]
}

This path efficiently navigates from CHAMBRE 2 to GARAGE and then to CHAMBRE 1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
