First, let me describe the rooms and doors for reference:

Rooms:
- PORCHE
- SEJOUR (large living area)
- CUISINE (kitchen)
- CELLIER
- DEGT (likely a hallway or passageway)
- CH.1 (bedroom 1)
- CH.2 (bedroom 2, split into multiple areas)
- BAINS (bathroom)
- WC (toilet)

Doors:
D1: Connects PORCHE to SEJOUR
D2: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
D3: Connects CUISINE to SEJOUR
D4: Connects SEJOUR to DEGT
D5: Connects DEGT to CH.1
D6: Connects DEGT to CH.2
D7: Connects DEGT to BAINS
D8: Connects DEGT to WC

Now, for the navigation plan from PORCHE to CH.1, then to CH.2:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"}
  ]
}
```

This path takes you from the PORCHE through the SEJOUR and DEGT to reach CH.1, and then back through DEGT to reach CH.2, using only the necessary doors along the way.
