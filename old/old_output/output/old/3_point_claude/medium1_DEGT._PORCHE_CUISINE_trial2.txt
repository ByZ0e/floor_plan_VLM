Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan as requested.

Rooms and Doors:
- DEGT: Connected to SEJOUR via D4, CH.2 via D6, and BAINS via D7
- SEJOUR: Connected to DEGT via D4, CUISINE via D3, and PORCHE via D1
- CUISINE: Connected to SEJOUR via D3 and CELLIER via D2
- PORCHE: Connected to SEJOUR via D1
- CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE via D2
- CH.1: Connected to SEJOUR via D5
- CH.2: Connected to DEGT via D6
- BAINS: Connected to DEGT via D7
- WC: Connected to DEGT via D8

Now, for the navigation plan from DEGT to PORCHE and then to CUISINE:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from DEGT to PORCHE and then to CUISINE using only the necessary doors. It avoids any unnecessary rooms or doors, ensuring a correct and direct path.
