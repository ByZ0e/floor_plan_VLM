Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms and doors, create a list of connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the CELLIER to the CH. PARENTS.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects TERRASSE COUVERTE and CUISINE
2. D2 connects CUISINE and CELLIER
3. D3 connects CUISINE and CH. PARENTS
4. D4 connects CH. PARENTS and DOUCHE

Based on these connections, here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CELLIER",
  "end": "CH. PARENTS",
  "actions": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the CELLIER to the CH. PARENTS using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours. The plan starts by exiting the CELLIER through D2, entering the CUISINE, and then using D3 to reach the CH. PARENTS.
