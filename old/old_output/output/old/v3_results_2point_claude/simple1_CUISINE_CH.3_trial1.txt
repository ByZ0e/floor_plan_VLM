Thank you for providing the floor plan. Let me first describe the rooms and doors with their connections based on the image:

Room and Door Connections:
1. CUISINE connects to SEJOUR through D5
2. SEJOUR connects to CH.1 through D4
3. SEJOUR connects to CH.2 through D3
4. CH.2 connects to CH.3 through D2
5. CH.3 connects to another part of SEJOUR through D1
6. SEJOUR has an internal connection through D6 (connecting different parts of the same room)

Now, let's create the navigation plan to go from CUISINE to CH.3:

```json
{
  "start": "CUISINE",
  "end": "CH.3",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2}
  ]
}
```

This path takes you from the CUISINE, through the SEJOUR, into CH.2, and finally into CH.3, using only the necessary doors for the most efficient route based on the provided floor plan.
