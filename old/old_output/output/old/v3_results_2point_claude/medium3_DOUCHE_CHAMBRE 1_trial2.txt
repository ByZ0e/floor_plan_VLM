Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first describe the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan to get from the DOUCHE to CHAMBRE 1.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects GARAGES to CELLIER
- D2: Connects HALL to DOUCHE
- D3: Connects CELLIER to CUISINE
- D4: Connects HALL to WC
- D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
- D6: Connects HALL to CUISINE
- D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE (second entrance)

Now, for the navigation plan from DOUCHE to CHAMBRE 1:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from the DOUCHE to CHAMBRE 1, using only the necessary doors (D2 and D5) and avoiding any unnecessary detours through other rooms or doors.
