Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the room and door connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan from CHAMBRE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
- D2: Connects HALL to WC
- D3: Connects HALL to HALL (different sections)
- D4: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
- D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 2
- D6: Connects HALL to PORCHE
- D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE
- D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
- D9: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
Starting from CHAMBRE 1, we need to navigate through the HALL, then to the CUISINE, and finally to the TERRASSE COUVERTE. Here's the detailed plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently guides you from CHAMBRE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
