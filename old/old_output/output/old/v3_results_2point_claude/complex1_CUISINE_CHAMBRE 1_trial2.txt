Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll start by listing the rooms and their door connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D7
2. HALL: Connected to CUISINE via D7, CHAMBRE 1 via D4, CHAMBRE 2 via D5, WC via D3, BAINS via D2, PORCHE via D6
3. CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D4
4. CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL via D5
5. WC: Connected to HALL via D3
6. BAINS: Connected to HALL via D2
7. PORCHE: Connected to HALL via D6
8. CELLIER: Connected to GARAGE via D9
9. GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER via D9
10. TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE via D8

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
To navigate from CUISINE to CHAMBRE 1, we need to follow these steps:

1. ApproachDoor(7)
2. OpenDoor(7)
3. GoThrough(7)
4. ApproachDoor(4)
5. OpenDoor(4)
6. GoThrough(4)

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CUISINE",
  "end": "CHAMBRE 1",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the CUISINE to CHAMBRE 1 using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
