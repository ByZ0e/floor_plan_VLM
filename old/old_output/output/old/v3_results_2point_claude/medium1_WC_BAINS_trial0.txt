Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the WC to the BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects SEJOUR to Porche
2. D2 connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
3. D3 connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
4. D4 connects SEJOUR to DEGT
5. D5 connects CH.1 to DEGT
6. D6 connects CH.2 to DEGT
7. D7 connects DEGT to BAINS
8. D8 connects CUISINE to DEGT

Now, for the navigation plan from WC to BAINS:

The most efficient path from WC to BAINS is through the DEGT (hallway). There's no direct door between WC and DEGT, so we'll need to go through the CUISINE first.

Here's the step-by-step navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 8
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 8
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 8
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 7
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 7
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 7
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the WC to the BAINS using only the necessary doors (D8 and D7) and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
