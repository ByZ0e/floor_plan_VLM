Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the connections and provide a navigation plan as requested.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER
D2: Connects CHAMBRE 1 and HALL
D3: Connects WC and HALL
D4: Connects BAINS and HALL
D5: Connects CHAMBRE 3 and HALL
D6: Connects CHAMBRE 2 and HALL
D7: Connects CELLIER and HALL
D8: Connects HALL and Porche

Now, I'll create a navigation plan from the WC to CHAMBRE 2:

{
  "plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 6
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 6
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 6
    }
  ]
}

This plan provides the most efficient path from the WC to CHAMBRE 2, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
