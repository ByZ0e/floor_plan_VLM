Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the PORCHE to the CUISINE.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects CELLIER and HALL
D2: Connects CHAMBRE 2 and HALL
D3: Connects HALL and BAINS
D4: Connects HALL and WC
D5: Connects PORCHE and HALL
D6: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 1
D7: Connects HALL and CUISINE
D8: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER

Navigation Plan:
To go from the PORCHE to the CUISINE, we only need to use two doors: D5 and D7.

Here's the step-by-step navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the PORCHE to the CUISINE using only the necessary doors. The robot will start in the PORCHE, go through D5 to enter the HALL, and then use D7 to reach the CUISINE.
