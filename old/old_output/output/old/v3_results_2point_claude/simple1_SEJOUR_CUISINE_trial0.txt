Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the SEJOUR to the CUISINE.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:
- D1: Connects SEJOUR to CH.3
- D2: Connects CH.3 to CH.2
- D3: Connects CH.2 to SEJOUR (small area labeled SEJOUR)
- D4: Connects SEJOUR (small area) to CH.1
- D5: Connects SEJOUR (main area) to CUISINE
- D6: Connects SEJOUR (main area) to SEJOUR (small area)

Navigation Plan:
To get from the SEJOUR (main area) to the CUISINE, we only need to use one door: D5.

Here's the step-by-step navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 5
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 5
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 5
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently takes you from the SEJOUR to the CUISINE using only the necessary door (D5) that directly connects these two rooms. No other doors or rooms need to be traversed for this particular navigation task.
