Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the GARAGES to the CELLIER.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects GARAGES to CELLIER
2. D2 connects GARAGES to HALL (near DOUCHE)
3. D3 connects CELLIER to CUISINE
4. D4 connects HALL to WC
5. D5 connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
6. D6 connects HALL to CUISINE
7. D7 connects HALL to CUISINE (lower part)

Now, let's create the navigation plan from GARAGES to CELLIER:

{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}

This plan is the most efficient and direct route from the GARAGES to the CELLIER. It involves using only one door (D1), which directly connects these two areas. There's no need to go through any other rooms or use any other doors for this particular navigation task.
