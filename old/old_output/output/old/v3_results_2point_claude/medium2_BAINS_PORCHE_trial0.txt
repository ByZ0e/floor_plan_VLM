Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from BAINS to PORCHE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER
2. D2: Connects CHAMBRE1 and HALL
3. D3: Connects BAINS and HALL
4. D4: Connects BAINS and HALL (another entrance)
5. D5: Connects CHAMBRE3 and HALL
6. D6: Connects CHAMBRE2 and HALL
7. D7: Connects CELLIER and HALL
8. D8: Connects HALL and PORCHE

Now, I'll create a navigation plan from BAINS to PORCHE:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from BAINS to PORCHE using only the necessary doors. The robot will exit BAINS through D3, enter the HALL, and then exit to the PORCHE through D8. This avoids any unnecessary rooms or doors along the path.
