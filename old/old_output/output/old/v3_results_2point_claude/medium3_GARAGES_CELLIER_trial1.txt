Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan to get from the GARAGES to the CELLIER.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects GARAGES to CELLIER
2. D2: Connects GARAGES to HALL (near DOUCHE)
3. D3: Connects CELLIER to CUISINE
4. D4: Connects HALL to WC
5. D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
6. D6: Connects HALL to CUISINE
7. D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE (lower part)

For the navigation task from GARAGES to CELLIER, we only need to use D1. Here's the step-by-step navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the GARAGES to the CELLIER using only the necessary door (D1) without passing through any unnecessary rooms or doors.
