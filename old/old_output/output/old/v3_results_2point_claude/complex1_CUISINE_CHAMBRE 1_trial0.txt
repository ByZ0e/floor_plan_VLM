Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the CUISINE to CHAMBRE 1.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects CELLIER and HALL
D2: Connects HALL and WC
D3: Connects HALL and BAINS
D4: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 1
D5: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 2
D6: Connects HALL and PORCHE
D7: Connects HALL and CUISINE
D8: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Connects CELLIER and GARAGE

Now, for the navigation plan from CUISINE to CHAMBRE 1:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the CUISINE to CHAMBRE 1 using only the necessary doors. It starts in the CUISINE, goes through door D7 to enter the HALL, and then through door D4 to reach CHAMBRE 1. This is the most direct path based on the floor plan provided.
