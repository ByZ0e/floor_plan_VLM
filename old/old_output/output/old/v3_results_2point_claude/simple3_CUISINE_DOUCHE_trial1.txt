Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms and doors, create a list of connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the CUISINE to the DOUCHE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects TERRASSE COUVERTE and CUISINE
2. D2 connects CUISINE and CELLIER
3. D3 connects CUISINE and CH. PARENTS
4. D4 connects CH. PARENTS and DOUCHE

Now, let's create the navigation plan from CUISINE to DOUCHE:

{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}

This plan provides the most efficient path from the CUISINE to the DOUCHE, using only the necessary doors (D3 and D4) to reach the destination. The robot will first move through D3 to enter the CH. PARENTS, and then through D4 to reach the DOUCHE.
