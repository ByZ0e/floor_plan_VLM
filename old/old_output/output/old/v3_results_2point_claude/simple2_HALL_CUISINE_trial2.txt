Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the HALL to the CUISINE.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

Rooms:
- HALL (multiple instances)
- CH.1
- CH.2
- BAINS
- GARAGE
- CUISINE

Doors and their connections:
D1: Connects HALL to BAINS
D2: Connects HALL to CH.1
D3: Connects HALL to CH.2
D4: Connects HALL to GARAGE
D5: Connects HALL to CUISINE

Based on these connections, here's the navigation plan to go from HALL to CUISINE:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5}
  ]
}
```

This plan is the most efficient route from the HALL to the CUISINE. Since you're starting in the HALL, and there's a direct connection from the HALL to the CUISINE through door D5, we only need to approach, open, and go through this single door to reach the destination. No other doors or rooms need to be traversed in this case.
