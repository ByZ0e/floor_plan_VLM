Certainly! I'll provide you with a detailed navigation plan based on the floor plan image you've shared. Let's start by listing out the rooms and doors with their connections:

Room and Door Connections:
1. CUISINE: Connected to SEJOUR through D5
2. SEJOUR (large room): Connected to CUISINE through D5, to CH.1 through D4, to CH.2 through D3, and to another part of SEJOUR through D6
3. CH.1: Connected to SEJOUR through D4
4. CH.2: Connected to SEJOUR through D3 and to CH.3 through D2
5. CH.3: Connected to CH.2 through D2 and to another part of SEJOUR through D1

Now, let's create the navigation plan to go from CUISINE to CH.3:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the CUISINE to CH.3 using the following path:
CUISINE -> D5 -> SEJOUR -> D3 -> CH.2 -> D2 -> CH.3

This is the most direct and efficient route based on the floor plan provided. It avoids unnecessary detours and uses only the doors required to reach the destination.
