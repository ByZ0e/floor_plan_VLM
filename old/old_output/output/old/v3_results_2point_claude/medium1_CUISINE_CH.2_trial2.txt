Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the CUISINE to CH.2.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects SEJOUR and Porche
- D2: Connects CUISINE and CELLIER
- D3: Connects CUISINE and SEJOUR
- D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
- D5: Connects DEGT and CH.1
- D6: Connects DEGT and CH.2
- D7: Connects DEGT and BAINS
- D8: Connects CUISINE and DEGT

Navigation Plan:
To get from CUISINE to CH.2, we'll use the following path: CUISINE -> DEGT -> CH.2

Here's the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the CUISINE to CH.2 using only the necessary doors (D8 and D6) without passing through any unnecessary rooms or doors.
