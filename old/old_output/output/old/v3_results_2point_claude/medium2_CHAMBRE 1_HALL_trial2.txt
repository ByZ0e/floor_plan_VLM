Certainly! I'll analyze the floor plan, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan for you to move from CHAMBRE 1 to the HALL.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER
2. D2: Connects CHAMBRE 1 and HALL
3. D3: Connects HALL and WC
4. D4: Connects HALL and BAINS
5. D5: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 3
6. D6: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 2
7. D7: Connects CELLIER and HALL
8. D8: Connects HALL and Porche

Navigation Plan:
To move from CHAMBRE 1 to HALL, we only need to use one door: D2. Here's the step-by-step plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 2
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 2
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 2
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from CHAMBRE 1 to the HALL using the most direct route available. You'll approach door D2, open it, and go through it to enter the HALL. No other doors or rooms need to be traversed for this particular navigation task.
