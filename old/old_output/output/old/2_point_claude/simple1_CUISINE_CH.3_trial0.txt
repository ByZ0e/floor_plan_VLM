Certainly! I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
- CUISINE: Connected to SEJOUR via D5
- SEJOUR: Connected to CUISINE via D5, to CH.1 via D4, to CH.2 via D3, and to CH.3 via D2
- CH.1: Connected to SEJOUR via D4
- CH.2: Connected to SEJOUR via D3
- CH.3: Connected to SEJOUR via D2 and to another CH.3 via D1

Now, for the navigation plan from CUISINE to CH.3:

1. ApproachDoor(D5)
2. OpenDoor(D5)
3. GoThrough(D5)
4. ApproachDoor(D2)
5. OpenDoor(D2)
6. GoThrough(D2)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"}
  ]
}
```

This path takes you from the CUISINE, through the SEJOUR, and directly into CH.3, using only the necessary doors D5 and D2. It's the most efficient route based on the floor plan provided.
