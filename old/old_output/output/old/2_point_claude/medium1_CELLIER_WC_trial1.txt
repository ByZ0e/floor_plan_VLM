Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the connections and provide you with an efficient navigation plan from the CELLIER to the WC. Let me first list out the rooms and doors with their connections:

Rooms and their connections:
1. CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE via D2
2. CUISINE: Connected to CELLIER via D2, SEJOUR via D3
3. SEJOUR: Connected to CUISINE via D3, DEGT via D4
4. DEGT: Connected to SEJOUR via D4, CH.2 via D6, BAINS via D7
5. CH.1: Connected to DEGT via D5
6. CH.2: Connected to DEGT via D6
7. BAINS: Connected to DEGT via D7, WC via D8
8. WC: Connected to BAINS via D8

Doors and their connections:
D1: Connects SEJOUR to Porche (not needed for this route)
D2: Connects CELLIER and CUISINE
D3: Connects CUISINE and SEJOUR
D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
D5: Connects DEGT and CH.1 (not needed for this route)
D6: Connects DEGT and CH.2 (not needed for this route)
D7: Connects DEGT and BAINS
D8: Connects BAINS and WC

Now, I'll provide you with the efficient navigation plan from CELLIER to WC:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently guide you from the CELLIER to the WC, using only the necessary doors along the path.
