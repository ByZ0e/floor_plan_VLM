Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide you with an efficient navigation plan from the DOUCHE to the CELLIER.

Room and Door Connections:
1. DOUCHE: Connected to CUISINE via D4
2. CH. PARENTS: Connected to CUISINE via D3
3. CUISINE (main area): Connected to DOUCHE via D4, CH. PARENTS via D3, and CELLIER via D2
4. CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE via D2
5. TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE via D1

Now, let's create the navigation plan from DOUCHE to CELLIER:

{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(D4)",
    "OpenDoor(D4)",
    "GoThrough(D4)",
    "ApproachDoor(D2)",
    "OpenDoor(D2)",
    "GoThrough(D2)"
  ]
}

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the DOUCHE to the CELLIER using the most direct route. You'll start by exiting the DOUCHE through D4, entering the main CUISINE area, then approach and go through D2 to reach the CELLIER.
