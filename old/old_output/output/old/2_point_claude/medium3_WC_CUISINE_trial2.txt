Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the connections and provide you with an efficient navigation plan from the WC to the CUISINE.

First, let's list out the rooms and doors with their connections:

Rooms and their connected doors:
- WC: D4
- HALL: D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7
- DOUCHE: D2
- CHAMBRE 1: D5
- CELLIER: D1, D3
- CUISINE: D6, D7
- GARAGES: D1

Doors and the rooms they connect:
- D1: GARAGES - CELLIER
- D2: HALL - DOUCHE
- D3: HALL - CELLIER
- D4: HALL - WC
- D5: HALL - CHAMBRE 1
- D6: HALL - CUISINE
- D7: HALL - CUISINE

Now, for the navigation plan from WC to CUISINE:

{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "target": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "target": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "target": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "target": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "target": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "target": "D6"}
  ]
}

This plan provides the most direct and efficient path from the WC to the CUISINE, using only the necessary doors (D4 and D6) and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
