I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan.

Rooms and Doors:
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D6
- CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL via D2
- CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D7, to TERRASSE COUVERTE via D8
- BAINS: Connected to HALL via D3
- WC: Connected to HALL via D4
- GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER via D9
- CELLIER: Connected to CELLIER (another part) via D1, to GARAGE via D9
- PORCHE: Connected to HALL via D5

Navigation Plan:
To go from CHAMBRE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE, the most efficient path is:

1. Exit CHAMBRE 1 to HALL
2. Go through HALL to CUISINE
3. Exit CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE

Here's the detailed plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from CHAMBRE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
