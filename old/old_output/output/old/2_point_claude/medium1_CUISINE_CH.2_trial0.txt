Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide the navigation plan to get from CUISINE to CH.2.

Rooms and Doors:
- CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE via D2
- CUISINE: Connected to SEJOUR via D3, to CELLIER via D2
- SEJOUR: Connected to CUISINE via D3, to DEGT via D4, to Porche via D1
- DEGT: Connected to SEJOUR via D4, to CH.1 via D5, to CH.2 via D6, to BAINS via D7
- CH.1: Connected to DEGT via D5
- CH.2: Connected to DEGT via D6
- BAINS: Connected to DEGT via D7, to WC via D8
- WC: Connected to BAINS via D8

Navigation Plan:
To go from CUISINE to CH.2, we need to pass through SEJOUR and DEGT. Here's the efficient navigation plan:

{
  "plan": [
    "ApproachDoor(D3)",
    "OpenDoor(D3)",
    "GoThrough(D3)",
    "ApproachDoor(D4)",
    "OpenDoor(D4)",
    "GoThrough(D4)",
    "ApproachDoor(D6)",
    "OpenDoor(D6)",
    "GoThrough(D6)"
  ]
}

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the CUISINE to CH.2 using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
