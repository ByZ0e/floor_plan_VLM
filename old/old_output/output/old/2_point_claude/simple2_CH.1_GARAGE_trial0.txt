Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout and provide you with a detailed navigation plan as requested. First, let me list out the rooms and doors with their connections:

Rooms and their connections:
- CH.1: Connected to HALL via D2
- CH.2: Connected to HALL via D3
- BAINS: Connected to HALL via D1
- GARAGE: Connected to CUISINE via D4
- CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D5

Doors and their connections:
- D1: Connects BAINS and HALL
- D2: Connects CH.1 and HALL
- D3: Connects CH.2 and HALL
- D4: Connects GARAGE and CUISINE
- D5: Connects CUISINE and HALL

Now, for the navigation plan from CH.1 to GARAGE:

{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(D2)",
    "OpenDoor(D2)",
    "GoThrough(D2)",
    "ApproachDoor(D5)",
    "OpenDoor(D5)",
    "GoThrough(D5)",
    "ApproachDoor(D4)",
    "OpenDoor(D4)",
    "GoThrough(D4)"
  ]
}

This plan will efficiently navigate you from CH.1 to the GARAGE using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours. The path goes through the HALL and CUISINE before reaching the GARAGE, which is the most direct route based on the floor plan provided.
