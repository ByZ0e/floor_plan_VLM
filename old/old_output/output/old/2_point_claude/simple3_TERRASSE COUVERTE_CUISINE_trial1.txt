Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan.

Rooms and Doors:
- TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE via D1
- CUISINE (main area): Connected to TERRASSE COUVERTE via D1, to upper CUISINE via D2, to CH. PARENTS via D3
- Upper CUISINE: Connected to main CUISINE via D2, has CELLIER
- CH. PARENTS: Connected to main CUISINE via D3, to DOUCHE via D4
- DOUCHE: Connected to CH. PARENTS via D4

Now, for the navigation plan from TERRASSE COUVERTE to CUISINE:

The plan is very simple as the TERRASSE COUVERTE is directly connected to the CUISINE via door D1. Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently take you from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to the CUISINE using the most direct path available.
