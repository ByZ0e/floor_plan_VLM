Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout and provide you with a detailed navigation plan to move from the GARAGE to CH.2. First, let me list out the rooms and doors with their connections:

Rooms and their connections:
- GARAGE: Connected to CUISINE via D4
- CUISINE: Connected to GARAGE via D4, connected to HALL via D5
- HALL: Connected to CUISINE via D5, connected to CH.1 via D2, connected to CH.2 via D3
- CH.1: Connected to HALL via D2, connected to BAINS via D1
- CH.2: Connected to HALL via D3
- BAINS: Connected to CH.1 via D1

Doors:
D1: Connects CH.1 and BAINS
D2: Connects CH.1 and HALL
D3: Connects CH.2 and HALL
D4: Connects GARAGE and CUISINE
D5: Connects CUISINE and HALL

Now, I'll provide you with the efficient navigation plan to move from the GARAGE to CH.2:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently guide you from the GARAGE to CH.2 using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
