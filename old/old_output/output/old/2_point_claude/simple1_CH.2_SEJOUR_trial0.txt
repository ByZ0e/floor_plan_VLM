Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze it and provide you with the necessary information and navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
- CH.2 is connected to SEJOUR via door D3
- SEJOUR is a large area that spans multiple sections of the floor plan

Now, for the navigation plan from CH.2 to SEJOUR:

The most efficient path is simply to use door D3, which directly connects CH.2 to SEJOUR. Here's the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CH.2",
  "end": "SEJOUR",
  "path": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D3"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D3"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D3"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from CH.2 to SEJOUR using the most direct route available. You'll approach door D3, open it, and go through to enter the SEJOUR area. No unnecessary doors or rooms are included in this path.
