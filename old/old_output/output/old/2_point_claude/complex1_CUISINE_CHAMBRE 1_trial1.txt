Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan.

Rooms and Doors:
- CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D7
- HALL: Central area connecting multiple rooms
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D4
- CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL via D5
- BAINS: Connected to HALL via D2
- WC: Connected to HALL via D3
- CELLIER: Connected to HALL via D1
- GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER via D9
- PORCHE: Connected to HALL via D6
- TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE via D8

Navigation Plan:
To go from CUISINE to CHAMBRE 1, we need to use the following path:
CUISINE -> D7 -> HALL -> D4 -> CHAMBRE 1

Here's the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the CUISINE to CHAMBRE 1 using only the necessary doors along the path.
