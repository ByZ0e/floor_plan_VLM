Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout and provide you with a detailed navigation plan as requested. First, let me list out the rooms and doors with their connections:

Rooms and their connections:
- GARAGE: Connected to CUISINE via D4
- CUISINE: Connected to GARAGE via D4, and to HALL via D5
- HALL: Central area connecting multiple rooms
- BAINS: Connected to HALL via D1
- CH.1: Connected to HALL via D2
- CH.2: Connected to HALL via D3

Doors and their connections:
- D1: Connects BAINS to HALL
- D2: Connects CH.1 to HALL
- D3: Connects CH.2 to HALL
- D4: Connects GARAGE to CUISINE
- D5: Connects CUISINE to HALL

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan to go from GARAGE to CH.2:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently guide you from the GARAGE to CH.2 using only the necessary doors. The path goes through the GARAGE, then to the CUISINE, into the HALL, and finally into CH.2.
