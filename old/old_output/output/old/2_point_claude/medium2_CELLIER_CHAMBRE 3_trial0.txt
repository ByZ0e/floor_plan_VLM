Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
- CELLIER: Connected to HALL via D7
- HALL: Connected to CHAMBRE 1 via D2, CHAMBRE 2 via D6, and BAINS via D4
- BAINS: Connected to HALL via D4, and WC via D3
- WC: Connected to BAINS via D3
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D2, and GARAGE via D1
- CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL via D6
- CHAMBRE 3: Connected to HALL via D5
- GARAGE: Connected to CHAMBRE 1 via D1
- Porche: Connected to HALL via D8

Now, for the navigation plan from CELLIER to CHAMBRE 3:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the CELLIER to CHAMBRE 3 using the minimum number of necessary doors. The robot will exit the CELLIER through D7 into the HALL, then approach and go through D5 to enter CHAMBRE 3, completing the navigation task.
