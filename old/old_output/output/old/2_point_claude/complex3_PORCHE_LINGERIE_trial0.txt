Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan as requested.

Rooms and Doors:
- Porche: Connected to Cellier via D3
- Cellier: Connected to Porche via D3, Hall via D11
- Hall: Connected to Cellier via D11, WC via D4, Lingerie via D5
- WC: Connected to Hall via D4
- Lingerie: Connected to Hall via D5

Now, for the navigation plan from Porche to Lingerie:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the Porche to the Lingerie using only the necessary doors. It avoids any unnecessary rooms or doors, providing a direct path through the Cellier and Hall to reach the final destination.
