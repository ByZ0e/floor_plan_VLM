Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout and provide you with a detailed navigation plan from the BAINS to the PORCHE. First, let me list out the rooms and doors with their connections:

Rooms and their connections:
- BAINS: Connected to HALL via D4
- CHAMBRE 3: Connected to HALL via D5
- CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL via D6
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D2
- GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER via D1
- CELLIER: Connected to HALL via D7
- HALL: Central area connecting multiple rooms
- PORCHE: Connected to HALL via D8

Doors:
- D1: Between GARAGE and CELLIER
- D2: Between CHAMBRE 1 and HALL
- D3: Between WC and HALL
- D4: Between BAINS and HALL
- D5: Between CHAMBRE 3 and HALL
- D6: Between CHAMBRE 2 and HALL
- D7: Between CELLIER and HALL
- D8: Between HALL and PORCHE

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan from BAINS to PORCHE:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from BAINS to PORCHE, using only the necessary doors (D4 and D8) and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors. The robot will exit the BAINS through D4, navigate through the HALL, and then use D8 to reach the PORCHE.
