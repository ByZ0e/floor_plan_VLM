Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan in JSON format.

Rooms and Doors:
- BAINS: Connected to HALL via D4
- CHAMBRE 3: Connected to HALL via D5
- CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL via D6
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D2
- GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER via D1
- CELLIER: Connected to HALL via D7
- PORCHE: Connected to HALL via D8
- WC: Connected to HALL via D3

Navigation Plan:
To go from BAINS to PORCHE, we need to go through the HALL. Here's the efficient path:

{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"}
  ]
}

This plan takes you from BAINS to HALL through D4, then from HALL to PORCHE through D8, which is the most direct and efficient route based on the floor plan provided.
