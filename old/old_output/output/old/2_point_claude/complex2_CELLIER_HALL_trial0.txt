Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing out the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide the navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
- CELLIER: Connected to CELLIER (another part) via D1
- CELLIER (second part): Connected to GARAGE via D9, and to HALL via D1
- HALL: Central area connecting multiple rooms
- CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL via D2
- BAINS: Connected to HALL via D3
- WC: Connected to HALL via D4
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D6
- PORCHE: Connected to HALL via D5
- CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D7, and to TERRASSE COUVERTE via D8

Now, for the navigation plan from CELLIER to HALL:

{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(D1)",
    "OpenDoor(D1)",
    "GoThrough(D1)"
  ]
}

This plan will efficiently move you from the CELLIER to the HALL using the most direct route. You'll approach door D1, open it, and go through it to enter the HALL area. No other doors or rooms need to be traversed for this particular navigation task.
