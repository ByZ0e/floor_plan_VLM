Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan.

Rooms and Doors:
- CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE via D2
- CUISINE: Large central area, connected to CELLIER via D2, TERRASSE COUVERTE via D1, and CH. PARENTS via D3
- TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE via D1
- CH. PARENTS: Connected to CUISINE via D3, and to DOUCHE via D4
- DOUCHE: Connected to CH. PARENTS via D4

Navigation Plan:
To navigate from CELLIER to CH. PARENTS, we need to go through the CUISINE. Here's the efficient path:

{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(D2)",
    "OpenDoor(D2)",
    "GoThrough(D2)",
    "ApproachDoor(D3)",
    "OpenDoor(D3)",
    "GoThrough(D3)"
  ]
}

This plan will take you from the CELLIER, through the CUISINE, and into the CH. PARENTS efficiently, using only the necessary doors (D2 and D3) that are part of the direct path between the start and end points.
