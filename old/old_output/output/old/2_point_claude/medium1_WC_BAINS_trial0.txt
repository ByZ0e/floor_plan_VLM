To begin, I'll list out the rooms and doors with their connections based on the floor plan:

Rooms:
- WC
- BAINS
- DEGT
- CH.2
- CH.1
- SEJOUR
- CUISINE
- CELLIER

Doors:
D8: Connects WC to DEGT
D7: Connects BAINS to DEGT
D6: Connects DEGT to CH.2
D5: Connects DEGT to CH.1
D4: Connects DEGT to SEJOUR
D3: Connects CUISINE to SEJOUR
D2: Connects CUISINE to CELLIER
D1: Connects SEJOUR to Porche (outside)

Now, for the navigation plan from WC to BAINS:

The most direct and efficient path is:

1. Exit WC through D8 into DEGT
2. From DEGT, enter BAINS through D7

Here's the plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct route from the WC to the BAINS, using only the necessary doors (D8 and D7) and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
