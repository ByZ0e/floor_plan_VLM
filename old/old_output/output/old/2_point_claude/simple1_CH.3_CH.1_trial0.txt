Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first describe the rooms and doors, then provide the navigation plan.

Room and Door Descriptions:
- CH.3: Connected to SEJOUR via D1 and D2
- CH.2: Connected to SEJOUR via D3
- CH.1: Connected to SEJOUR via D4
- SEJOUR: Large central area connected to all other rooms
- CUISINE: Connected to SEJOUR via D6
- D5: Connects CUISINE to another part of SEJOUR

Navigation Plan:
To go from CH.3 to CH.1, we need to go through the SEJOUR. Here's the efficient path:

{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(D2)",
    "OpenDoor(D2)",
    "GoThrough(D2)",
    "ApproachDoor(D4)",
    "OpenDoor(D4)",
    "GoThrough(D4)"
  ]
}

This plan takes you from CH.3 to the SEJOUR using D2, then from the SEJOUR to CH.1 using D4. It's the most direct route available based on the floor plan provided.
