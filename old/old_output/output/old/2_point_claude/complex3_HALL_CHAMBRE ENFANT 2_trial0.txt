Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2.

Rooms and Doors:
- HALL (central area, connects to most rooms)
- GARAGE (connected to HALL via D1)
- CELLIER (three separate areas, connected to HALL via D2 and D3)
- WC (connected to HALL via D4)
- LINGERIE (connected to HALL via D5)
- BUREAU (connected to HALL via D6)
- BAINS (connected to HALL via D7)
- CHAMBRE PARENTS (connected to HALL via D8)
- CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 (connected to HALL via D10)
- CHAMBRE ENFANT 2 (connected to HALL via D9)
- PORCHE (outside area, not relevant for this navigation)

After careful analysis, here's the efficient navigation plan to get from the HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"}
  ]
}
```

This plan is the most direct and efficient route from the HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2. The robot starts in the HALL, approaches door D9, opens it, and goes through to reach CHAMBRE ENFANT 2. No other doors or rooms need to be traversed for this particular navigation task.
