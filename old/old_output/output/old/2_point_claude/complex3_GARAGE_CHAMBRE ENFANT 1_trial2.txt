Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide the navigation plan.

Rooms and Doors:
- Garage: Connected to Hall via D1
- Cellier (3 rooms): Connected to Hall via D2 and D3
- Hall: Central area connecting most rooms
- WC: Connected to Hall via D4
- Lingerie: Connected to Hall via D5
- Bureau: Connected to Hall via D6
- Bains: Connected to Hall via D7
- Chambre Parents: Connected to Hall via D8
- Chambre Enfant 2: Connected to Hall via D9
- Chambre Enfant 1: Connected to Hall via D10
- Porche: Connected to Cellier via D3

Navigation Plan:
To go from the Garage to Chambre Enfant 1, the most efficient path is:

1. ApproachDoor(D1)
2. OpenDoor(D1)
3. GoThrough(D1)
4. ApproachDoor(D10)
5. OpenDoor(D10)
6. GoThrough(D10)

Here's the plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D10"}
  ]
}
```

This path takes you directly from the Garage through the Hall to Chambre Enfant 1, using only the necessary doors (D1 and D10) and avoiding any unnecessary detours or rooms.
