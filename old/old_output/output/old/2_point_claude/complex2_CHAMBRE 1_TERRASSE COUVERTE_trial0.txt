Certainly! I'll start by listing out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan in JSON format.

Room and Door Connections:
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D6
- HALL: Central area connecting multiple rooms
- CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D7
- TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE via D8

Navigation Plan:
To go from CHAMBRE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE, we need to pass through the HALL and CUISINE. Here's the plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates you from CHAMBRE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE using only the necessary doors (D6, D7, and D8) and passing through the required rooms (HALL and CUISINE) to reach your destination.
