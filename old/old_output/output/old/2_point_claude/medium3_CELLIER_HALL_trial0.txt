Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing out the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide you with a navigation plan to get from the CELLIER to the HALL.

Room and Door Connections:
- CELLIER: Connected to GARAGES via D1, to CUISINE via D3
- GARAGES: Connected to CELLIER via D1
- CUISINE: Connected to CELLIER via D3, to HALL via D6
- WC: Connected to HALL via D4
- DOUCHE: Connected to HALL via D2
- CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D5
- HALL: Connected to CUISINE via D6, to WC via D4, to DOUCHE via D2, to CHAMBRE 1 via D5

Now, for the navigation plan from CELLIER to HALL:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently guide you from the CELLIER to the HALL using the most direct route. You'll start in the CELLIER, go through D3 to enter the CUISINE, and then use D6 to reach the HALL. This avoids any unnecessary detours through other rooms or doors.
