Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide the navigation plan from the BUREAU to the BAINS.

Rooms and Doors:
- BUREAU: Connected to HALL via D6
- BAINS: Connected to HALL via D7
- HALL: Central area connecting multiple rooms

Navigation Plan:
To go from the BUREAU to the BAINS, we need to use two doors: D6 and D7. Here's the detailed plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently guide you from the BUREAU to the BAINS using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
