Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and their door connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from CHAMBRE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CHAMBRE 1 - D6 - HALL
2. HALL - D4 - WC
3. HALL - D3 - BAINS
4. HALL - D2 - CHAMBRE 2
5. HALL - D7 - CUISINE
6. CHAMBRE 2 - D5 - PORCHE
7. PORCHE - D5 - HALL
8. CUISINE - D8 - TERRASSE COUVERTE
9. GARAGE - D9 - CELLIER
10. CELLIER - D1 - HALL

Navigation Plan:
To get from CHAMBRE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE, we need to go through the following sequence:

1. Exit CHAMBRE 1 to HALL
2. Go from HALL to CUISINE
3. Exit CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE

Here's the detailed action plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D6"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D6"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D6"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D7"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D7"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D7"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D8"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D8"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D8"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from CHAMBRE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
