Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan to get from the HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2.

Explicit Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER
D2: Connects CELLIER and PORCHE
D3: Connects PORCHE and HALL
D4: Connects HALL and WC
D5: Connects HALL and LINGERIE
D6: Connects HALL and BUREAU
D7: Connects HALL and BAINS
D8: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE PARENTS
D9: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
D10: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
D11: Connects CELLIER and HALL

Now, for the navigation plan from HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 9}
  ]
}
```

This plan is the most efficient route from the HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2. Since we start in the HALL, we only need to approach, open, and go through door D9, which directly connects the HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2. No other doors or rooms need to be traversed in this case.
