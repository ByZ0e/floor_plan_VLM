Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms, doors, and their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from CH.3 to CH.1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CH.3 connects to SEJOUR through D1
2. SEJOUR connects to CH.2 through D2
3. CH.2 connects to SEJOUR through D3
4. SEJOUR connects to CH.1 through D4
5. SEJOUR connects to CUISINE through D5 and D6 (not needed for this path)

Now, I'll create a step-by-step navigation plan from CH.3 to CH.1:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CH.3 to CH.1 using the minimum number of necessary doors. The robot starts in CH.3, goes through D1 to enter the SEJOUR, and then directly proceeds to D4 to enter CH.1, reaching the destination.
