Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and door connections, then provide the navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
- DOUCHE connects to CUISINE via D4
- CUISINE connects to CH. PARENTS via D3
- CUISINE connects to CELLIER via D2
- TERRASSE COUVERTE connects to CUISINE via D1

Now, for the navigation plan from DOUCHE to CELLIER:

1. ApproachDoor(D4)
2. OpenDoor(D4)
3. GoThrough(D4)
4. ApproachDoor(D2)
5. OpenDoor(D2)
6. GoThrough(D2)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"}
  ]
}
```

This path takes you from the DOUCHE, through the CUISINE, and directly to the CELLIER using the most efficient route based on the provided floor plan.
