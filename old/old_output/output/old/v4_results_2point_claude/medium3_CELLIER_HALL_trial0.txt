Certainly! I'll start by providing a clear list of rooms and doors with their connections based on the floor plan image, and then I'll give you the navigation plan to go from the CELLIER to the HALL.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects GARAGES to CELLIER
2. D2: Connects GARAGES to DOUCHE
3. D3: Connects CELLIER to CUISINE
4. D4: Connects WC to HALL
5. D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
6. D6: Connects CUISINE to HALL
7. D7: Connects CUISINE to HALL

Now, for the navigation plan from CELLIER to HALL:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently take you from the CELLIER to the HALL using the following steps:
1. Approach door D3 (which connects CELLIER to CUISINE)
2. Open door D3
3. Go through door D3 to enter the CUISINE
4. Approach door D6 (which connects CUISINE to HALL)
5. Open door D6
6. Go through door D6 to enter the HALL

This is the most direct and efficient path from the CELLIER to the HALL based on the provided floor plan. The plan avoids unnecessary doors and rooms, ensuring you reach your destination using the shortest possible route.
