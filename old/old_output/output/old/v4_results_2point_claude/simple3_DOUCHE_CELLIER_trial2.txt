Thank you for providing the floor plan image. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the DOUCHE to the CELLIER.

Room and Door Connections:
1. DOUCHE: Connected to CUISINE via D4
2. CUISINE: Connected to DOUCHE via D4, connected to CH. PARENTS via D3, connected to CELLIER via D2
3. CH. PARENTS: Connected to CUISINE via D3
4. CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE via D2
5. TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE via D1

Navigation Plan from DOUCHE to CELLIER:

1. ApproachDoor(D4)
2. OpenDoor(D4)
3. GoThrough(D4)
4. ApproachDoor(D2)
5. OpenDoor(D2)
6. GoThrough(D2)

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "DOUCHE",
  "end": "CELLIER",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the DOUCHE to the CELLIER using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
