Certainly! I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan in JSON format.

Explicit Room and Door Connections:

D1: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER
D2: Connects PORCHE and CELLIER
D3: Connects PORCHE and HALL
D4: Connects HALL and WC
D5: Connects HALL and LINGERIE
D6: Connects HALL and BUREAU
D7: Connects HALL and BAINS
D8: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE PARENTS
D9: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
D10: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
D11: Connects CELLIER and HALL

Now, for the navigation plan from CHAMBRE PARENTS to CELLIER:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 11}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CHAMBRE PARENTS to CELLIER using the necessary doors. It starts by exiting CHAMBRE PARENTS through D8 into the HALL, then moves directly to CELLIER through D11. This is the most direct and efficient path based on the floor plan and the given door connections.
