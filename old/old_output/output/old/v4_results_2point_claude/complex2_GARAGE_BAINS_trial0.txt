Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the GARAGE to the BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D9: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER
2. D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
3. D2: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to HALL
4. D5: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to PORCHE
5. D3: Connects HALL to BAINS
6. D4: Connects HALL to WC
7. D6: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
8. D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE
9. D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan from the GARAGE to the BAINS:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 9},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

This path takes you from the GARAGE through the CELLIER and HALL to reach the BAINS efficiently, using only the necessary doors along the way.
