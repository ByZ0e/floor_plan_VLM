Certainly! I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections based on the floor plan, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Garage <-> Cellier
2. D2: Cellier <-> Porche
3. D3: Porche <-> Hall
4. D4: Hall <-> WC
5. D5: Hall <-> Lingerie
6. D6: Hall <-> Bureau
7. D7: Hall <-> Bains
8. D8: Hall <-> Chambre Parents
9. D9: Hall <-> Chambre Enfant 2
10. D10: Hall <-> Chambre Enfant 1
11. D11: Cellier <-> Hall

Navigation Plan:
To navigate from the Garage to Chambre Enfant 1, we'll use the following sequence of actions:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 11},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 10}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the Garage to Chambre Enfant 1 using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours. The robot will start in the Garage, move through the Cellier, enter the main Hall, and finally reach Chambre Enfant 1.
