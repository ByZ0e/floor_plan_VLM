Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the room and door connections, then provide a navigation plan from the CUISINE to CH.2.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
D2: Connects CUISINE and CELLIER
D3: Connects CUISINE and SEJOUR
D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
D5: Connects CH.1 and DEGT
D6: Connects DEGT and CH.2
D7: Connects DEGT and BAINS
D8: Connects CUISINE and DEGT

Based on these connections, here's the navigation plan from CUISINE to CH.2:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from the CUISINE to CH.2. It involves going through the DEGT (hallway) which connects these two rooms. The plan avoids any unnecessary detours through other rooms or doors.
