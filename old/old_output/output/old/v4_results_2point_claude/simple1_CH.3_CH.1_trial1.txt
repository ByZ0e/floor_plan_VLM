Thank you for providing the floor plan image. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan from CH.3 to CH.1.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

Rooms:
- CH.3
- CH.2 (two instances)
- CH.1 (two instances)
- SEJOUR (multiple instances, representing a large common area)
- CUISINE

Doors and their connections:
D1: Connects CH.3 to SEJOUR
D2: Connects CH.2 to SEJOUR
D3: Connects CH.2 to SEJOUR
D4: Connects CH.1 to SEJOUR
D5: Connects CUISINE to SEJOUR
D6: Connects CUISINE to SEJOUR

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan from CH.3 to CH.1 using only the necessary doors:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CH.3 to CH.1 using only the necessary doors (D1 and D4) and passing through the SEJOUR area. The plan avoids unnecessary rooms and doors, providing a direct path to the destination.
