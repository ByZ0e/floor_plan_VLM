Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from BAINS to PORCHE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER
2. D2: Connects CHAMBRE1 and HALL
3. D3: Connects BAINS and HALL
4. D4: Connects BAINS and HALL (another entrance)
5. D5: Connects CHAMBRE3 and HALL
6. D6: Connects CHAMBRE2 and HALL
7. D7: Connects CELLIER and HALL
8. D8: Connects HALL and PORCHE

Navigation Plan:
To go from BAINS to PORCHE, we need to use the following sequence of actions:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from BAINS to PORCHE using the minimum number of necessary doors. We start by exiting BAINS through D3 into the HALL, then proceed directly to D8 to reach the PORCHE. This route avoids any unnecessary rooms or doors, providing the most direct path to the destination.
