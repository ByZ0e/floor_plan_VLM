Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan to get from the GARAGES to the CELLIER.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects GARAGES to CELLIER
D2: Connects GARAGES to DOUCHE
D3: Connects CELLIER to CUISINE
D4: Connects WC to HALL
D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
D6: Connects HALL to CUISINE
D7: Connects CUISINE to HALL

Now, for the navigation task from GARAGES to CELLIER, here's the action plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient path from the GARAGES to the CELLIER. It involves only one door (D1), which directly connects these two spaces. No unnecessary rooms or doors are included in this navigation plan.
