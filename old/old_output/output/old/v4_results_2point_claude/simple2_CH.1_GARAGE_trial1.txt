Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from CH.1 to the GARAGE.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects CH.1 to HALL
D2: Connects CH.1 to HALL
D3: Connects CH.2 to HALL
D4: Connects GARAGE to CUISINE
D5: Connects CUISINE to HALL

Now, let's create the navigation plan from CH.1 to GARAGE:

1. Start in CH.1
2. Use D2 to enter the HALL
3. Move through the HALL to reach D4
4. Use D4 to enter the GARAGE

Here's the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 2
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 2
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 2
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 4
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from CH.1 to the GARAGE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
