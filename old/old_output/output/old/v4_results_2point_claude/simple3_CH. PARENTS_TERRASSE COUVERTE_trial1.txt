Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from CH. PARENTS to TERRASSE COUVERTE.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

Rooms:
1. CH. PARENTS
2. DOUCHE
3. CUISINE (multiple instances)
4. CELLIER
5. TERRASSE COUVERTE

Doors and their connections:
D1: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
D2: Connects CUISINE to CELLIER
D3: Connects CUISINE to CH. PARENTS
D4: Connects CH. PARENTS to DOUCHE

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan to go from CH. PARENTS to TERRASSE COUVERTE:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from CH. PARENTS to TERRASSE COUVERTE using the necessary doors. The plan avoids unnecessary rooms and doors, ensuring a direct path to the destination.
