Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from CH.3 to CH.1.

Explicit Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects CH.3 and SEJOUR (left)
2. D2 connects CH.2 and SEJOUR (left)
3. D3 connects CH.2 and SEJOUR (middle)
4. D4 connects CH.1 and SEJOUR (middle)
5. D5 connects SEJOUR (right) and CUISINE
6. D6 connects SEJOUR (bottom) and CUISINE

Navigation Plan:
To go from CH.3 to CH.1, we need to use doors D1 and D4. Here's the detailed plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from CH.3 to CH.1 using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
