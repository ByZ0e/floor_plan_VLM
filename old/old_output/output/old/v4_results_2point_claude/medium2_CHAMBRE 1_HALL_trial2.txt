Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from CHAMBRE 1 to the HALL.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER
2. D2: Connects CHAMBRE 1 to HALL
3. D3: Connects BAINS to HALL
4. D4: Connects CHAMBRE 3 to HALL
5. D5: Connects CHAMBRE 3 to HALL
6. D6: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to HALL
7. D7: Connects CELLIER to HALL
8. D8: Connects HALL to Porche

Navigation Plan:
To go from CHAMBRE 1 to HALL, we only need to use one door: D2. Here's the step-by-step plan:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently take you from CHAMBRE 1 to the HALL using the most direct route available according to the floor plan. You'll approach door D2, open it, and go through it to enter the HALL area.
