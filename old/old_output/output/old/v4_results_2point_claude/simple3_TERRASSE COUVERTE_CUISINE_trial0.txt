Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to the CUISINE.

Room and Door Connections:
- TERRASSE COUVERTE connects to CUISINE via D1
- CUISINE connects to CELLIER via D2
- CUISINE connects to CH. PARENTS via D3
- CH. PARENTS connects to DOUCHE via D4

Now, for the navigation plan from TERRASSE COUVERTE to CUISINE:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to the CUISINE using the most direct path. You'll approach D1, open it, and go through it to enter the CUISINE. Since the CUISINE is directly connected to the TERRASSE COUVERTE via D1, no additional steps are needed.
