Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the CELLIER to the CH. PARENTS.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CELLIER connects to CUISINE through D2
2. CUISINE connects to TERRASSE COUVERTE through D1
3. CUISINE connects to another part of CUISINE through D3
4. CUISINE connects to DOUCHE through D4
5. DOUCHE connects to CH. PARENTS (no door between them)

Now, let's create the navigation plan:

{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the CELLIER to the CH. PARENTS using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
