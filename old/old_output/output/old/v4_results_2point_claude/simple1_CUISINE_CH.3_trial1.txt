Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the CUISINE to CH.3.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects SEJOUR to CH.3
2. D2 connects CH.2 to SEJOUR
3. D3 connects CH.2 to SEJOUR
4. D4 connects CH.1 to SEJOUR
5. D5 connects CUISINE to SEJOUR
6. D6 connects CUISINE to SEJOUR

Now, let's create the navigation plan from CUISINE to CH.3:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently guide you from the CUISINE to CH.3 using the following steps:
1. Approach and go through D5 to enter the SEJOUR from the CUISINE.
2. Once in the SEJOUR, approach and go through D1 to enter CH.3, which is your final destination.

This plan uses the minimum number of necessary doors and avoids any unnecessary rooms or detours.
