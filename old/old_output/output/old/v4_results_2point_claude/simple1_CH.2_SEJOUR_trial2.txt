Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from CH.2 to SEJOUR.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CH.2 connects to SEJOUR through D3
2. CH.3 connects to SEJOUR through D1
3. CH.1 connects to SEJOUR through D4
4. SEJOUR connects to CUISINE through D5 and D6

Navigation Plan:
To go from CH.2 to SEJOUR, we only need to use one door: D3.

Here's the step-by-step navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CH.2",
  "end": "SEJOUR",
  "steps": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from CH.2 to SEJOUR using the most direct path available according to the floor plan.
