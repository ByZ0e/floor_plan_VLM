Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from CHAMBRE 1 to GARAGES.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects GARAGES and CELLIER
D2: Connects GARAGES and DOUCHE
D3: Connects CELLIER and CUISINE
D4: Connects HALL and WC
D5: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 1
D6: Connects HALL and CUISINE
D7: Connects HALL and CUISINE (second instance)

Navigation Plan:
To go from CHAMBRE 1 to GARAGES, we need to use the following doors: D5, D6, and D1.

Here's the step-by-step navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from CHAMBRE 1 to GARAGES using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
