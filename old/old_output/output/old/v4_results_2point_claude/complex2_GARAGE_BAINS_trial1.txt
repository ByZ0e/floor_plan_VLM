Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan to get from the GARAGE to the BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
1. GARAGE - D9 - CELLIER
2. CELLIER - D1 - HALL
3. CHAMBRE 2 - D2 - HALL
4. HALL - D3 - BAINS
5. HALL - D4 - WC
6. PORCHE - D5 - HALL
7. CHAMBRE 1 - D6 - HALL
7. CUISINE - D7 - HALL
8. CUISINE - D8 - TERRASSE COUVERTE

Navigation Plan from GARAGE to BAINS:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 9},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

This path takes you from the GARAGE through the CELLIER and HALL to reach the BAINS, using only the necessary doors along the way.
