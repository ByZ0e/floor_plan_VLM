Certainly! I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections based on the floor plan image, and then provide a detailed navigation plan to get from the CUISINE to CH.1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects BAINS to HALL
2. D2: Connects CH.1 to HALL
3. D3: Connects CH.2 to HALL
4. D4: Connects GARAGE to CUISINE
5. D5: Connects CUISINE to HALL

Navigation Plan:
To go from CUISINE to CH.1, we need to use doors D5 and D2. Here's the step-by-step plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 5
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 5
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 5
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 2
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 2
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 2
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the CUISINE to CH.1 using only the necessary doors. It starts by exiting the CUISINE through D5 into the HALL, then enters CH.1 through D2. The plan avoids unnecessary rooms and doors, providing a direct path to the destination.
