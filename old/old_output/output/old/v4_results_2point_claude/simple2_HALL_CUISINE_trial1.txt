Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the HALL to the CUISINE.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects HALL to BAINS
- D2: Connects HALL to CH.1
- D3: Connects HALL to CH.2
- D4: Connects HALL to GARAGE
- D5: Connects HALL to CUISINE

Now, for the navigation plan from HALL to CUISINE:

The most direct path from HALL to CUISINE is through door D5. Here's the step-by-step plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 5
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 5
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 5
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates you from the HALL to the CUISINE using the most direct route available. It avoids unnecessary doors and rooms, focusing solely on the required path to reach the destination.
