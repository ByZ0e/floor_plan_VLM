Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan to get from the WC to the BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects SEJOUR and Porche
2. D2: Connects CUISINE and CELLIER
3. D3: Connects CUISINE and SEJOUR
4. D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
5. D5: Connects DEGT and CH.1
6. D6: Connects DEGT and CH.2
7. D7: Connects DEGT and BAINS
8. D8: Connects DEGT and WC

Navigation Plan:
To go from the WC to the BAINS, we need to use two doors: D8 and D7. Here's the detailed plan:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the WC to the BAINS using only the necessary doors. The robot will start in the WC, go through D8 to enter the DEGT (hallway), and then use D7 to enter the BAINS, which is the final destination.
