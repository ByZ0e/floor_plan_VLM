Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from CH.2 to SEJOUR.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CH.2 connects to SEJOUR (large central area) via D2
2. CH.3 connects to SEJOUR (left side) via D1
3. CH.1 connects to SEJOUR (top right) via D4
4. CUISINE connects to SEJOUR (bottom right) via D5 and D6
5. D3 connects two parts of the SEJOUR

Navigation Plan:
To go from CH.2 to SEJOUR, we only need to use one door (D2). Here's the step-by-step plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CH.2",
  "end": "SEJOUR",
  "steps": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from CH.2 to SEJOUR using the most direct path available according to the floor plan.
