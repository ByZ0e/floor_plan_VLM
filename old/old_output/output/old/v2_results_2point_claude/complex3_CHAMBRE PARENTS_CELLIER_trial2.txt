Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list the rooms and door connections, then provide the navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects Garage and Cellier
2. D2: Connects Cellier and Porche
3. D3: Connects Porche and Hall
4. D4: Connects Hall and WC
5. D5: Connects Hall and Lingerie
6. D6: Connects Hall and Bureau
7. D7: Connects Hall and Bains
8. D8: Connects Hall and Chambre Parents
9. D9: Connects Hall and Chambre Enfant 2
10. D10: Connects Hall and Chambre Enfant 1
11. D11: Connects Hall and Cellier

Navigation Plan:
To navigate from Chambre Parents to Cellier, we'll use the following sequence of actions:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 11}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from Chambre Parents to Cellier using the necessary doors. It avoids unnecessary rooms and doors, providing a direct path to the destination.
