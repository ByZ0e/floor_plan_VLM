Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the SEJOUR to the CUISINE.

Rooms and Doors:
1. SEJOUR (multiple areas connected)
2. CH.1
3. CH.2
4. CH.3
5. CUISINE

Doors and their connections:
D1: Connects CH.3 to SEJOUR
D2: Connects CH.3 to CH.2
D3: Connects CH.2 to SEJOUR
D4: Connects CH.1 to SEJOUR
D5: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
D6: Connects SEJOUR to SEJOUR (different areas of the same room)

Based on these connections, here's the navigation plan from SEJOUR to CUISINE:

```json
{
  "start": "SEJOUR",
  "end": "CUISINE",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5}
  ]
}
```

This plan is the most efficient route from SEJOUR to CUISINE. Since you're starting in SEJOUR, you only need to approach, open, and go through door D5 to reach the CUISINE. No other doors or rooms need to be traversed in this case.
