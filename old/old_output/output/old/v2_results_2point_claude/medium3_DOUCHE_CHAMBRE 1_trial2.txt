Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the room and door connections, then provide the navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects GARAGES to CELLIER
- D2: Connects GARAGES to DOUCHE
- D3: Connects CELLIER to CUISINE
- D4: Connects WC to HALL
- D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
- D6: Connects HALL to CUISINE
- D7: Connects CUISINE to HALL

Now, for the navigation plan from DOUCHE to CHAMBRE 1:

1. ApproachDoor(D2)
2. OpenDoor(D2)
3. GoThrough(D2)
4. ApproachDoor(D5)
5. OpenDoor(D5)
6. GoThrough(D5)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"}
  ]
}
```

This path takes you from the DOUCHE, through the GARAGES and HALL, and finally into CHAMBRE 1, using only the necessary doors D2 and D5.
