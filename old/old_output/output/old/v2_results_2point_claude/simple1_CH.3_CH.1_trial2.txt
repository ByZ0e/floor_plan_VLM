Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CH.3 connects to SEJOUR through D1
2. CH.2 connects to CH.3 through D2
3. CH.2 connects to SEJOUR through D3
4. CH.1 connects to SEJOUR through D4
5. CUISINE connects to SEJOUR through D5 and D6

Now, for the navigation plan from CH.3 to CH.1:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan takes you from CH.3 to SEJOUR through D1, then from SEJOUR to CH.1 through D4. It's the most direct and efficient path based on the floor plan provided.
