Certainly! I'll analyze the floor plan, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the PORCHE to the CUISINE.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
D2: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to HALL
D3: Connects HALL to BAINS
D4: Connects HALL to WC
D5: Connects PORCHE to HALL
D6: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE
D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER

Navigation Plan:
To go from the PORCHE to the CUISINE, we only need to use two doors: D5 and D7.

Here's the step-by-step navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 5
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 5
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 5
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 7
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 7
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 7
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the PORCHE to the CUISINE using only the necessary doors. The robot will start in the PORCHE, go through D5 to enter the HALL, and then use D7 to reach the CUISINE. No unnecessary doors or rooms are included in this path.
