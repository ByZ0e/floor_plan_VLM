Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
- CH.2 is connected to SEJOUR via D2
- CH.2 is connected to CH.3 via D2
- CH.3 is connected to SEJOUR via D1
- CH.1 is connected to SEJOUR via D4
- CUISINE is connected to SEJOUR via D5 and D6

Now, for the navigation task from CH.2 to SEJOUR:

The most direct path is to use D2, which connects CH.2 directly to SEJOUR. Here's the step-by-step navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CH.2",
  "end": "SEJOUR",
  "steps": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CH.2 to SEJOUR using the most direct route available through door D2.
