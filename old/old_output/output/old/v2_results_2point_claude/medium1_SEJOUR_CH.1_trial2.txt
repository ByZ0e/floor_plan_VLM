Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms and doors, create a list of connections, and then provide a navigation plan from SEJOUR to CH.1.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
D2: Connects CUISINE to CELLIER
D3: Connects CUISINE to SEJOUR
D4: Connects SEJOUR to DEGT
D5: Connects DEGT to CH.1
D6: Connects DEGT to CH.2
D7: Connects DEGT to BAINS
D8: Connects DEGT to WC

Now, let's create the navigation plan from SEJOUR to CH.1:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from SEJOUR to CH.1 using only the necessary doors. The robot will start in SEJOUR, go through D4 to enter DEGT, and then use D5 to reach CH.1.
