Thank you for providing the floor plan image. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide the navigation plan from GARAGES to CELLIER.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects GARAGES to CELLIER
2. D2: Connects GARAGES to DOUCHE
3. D3: Connects CELLIER to CUISINE
4. D4: Connects WC to HALL
5. D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
6. D6: Connects HALL to CUISINE
7. D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE (second instance)

For the navigation task from GARAGES to CELLIER, we only need to use D1. Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from GARAGES to CELLIER using only the necessary door (D1) without going through any unnecessary rooms or doors.
