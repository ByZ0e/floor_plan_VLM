Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects Cellier to Hall
D2: Connects Bains to Hall
D3: Connects WC to Hall
D4: Connects Hall to Chambre 1
D5: Connects Hall to Chambre 2
D6: Connects Hall to Porche
D7: Connects Hall to Cuisine
D8: Connects Cuisine to Terrasse Couverte
D9: Connects Cellier to Garage

Now, for the navigation plan from Cuisine to Chambre 1:

1. ApproachDoor(D7)
2. OpenDoor(D7)
3. GoThrough(D7)
4. ApproachDoor(D4)
5. OpenDoor(D4)
6. GoThrough(D4)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the Cuisine to Chambre 1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
