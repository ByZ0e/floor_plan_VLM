Navigation Plan:
To go from BAINS to TERRASSE COUVERTE, we need to use the following path: BAINS -> HALL -> CUISINE -> TERRASSE COUVERTE

Here's the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from BAINS to TERRASSE COUVERTE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
