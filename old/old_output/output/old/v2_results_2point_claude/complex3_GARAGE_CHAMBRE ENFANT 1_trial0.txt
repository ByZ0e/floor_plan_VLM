Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the GARAGE to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER
- D2: Connects CELLIER to PORCHE
- D3: Connects PORCHE to HALL
- D4: Connects HALL to WC
- D5: Connects HALL to LINGERIE
- D6: Connects HALL to BUREAU
- D7: Connects HALL to BAINS
- D8: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE PARENTS
- D9: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
- D10: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
- D11: Connects CELLIER to HALL

Navigation Plan:
To get from the GARAGE to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1, we'll use the following path: GARAGE -> CELLIER -> HALL -> CHAMBRE ENFANT 1

Here's the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 11},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 10}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the GARAGE to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
