Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a detailed navigation plan to get from CUISINE to CH.2.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1 connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
- D2 connects CUISINE and CELLIER
- D3 connects CUISINE and SEJOUR
- D4 connects SEJOUR and DEGT
- D5 connects CH.1 and DEGT
- D6 connects DEGT and CH.2
- D7 connects DEGT and BAINS
- D8 connects CUISINE and WC

Navigation Plan:
To get from CUISINE to CH.2, we need to go through the following doors: D3, D4, and D6.

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CUISINE
2. Use D3 to enter SEJOUR
3. Use D4 to enter DEGT
4. Use D6 to enter CH.2

Here's the detailed action plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from CUISINE to CH.2, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
