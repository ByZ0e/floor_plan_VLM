Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and their door connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2.

Navigation Plan:
Starting from the HALL, we need to reach CHAMBRE ENFANT 2. The most direct path is:

1. ApproachDoor(9)
2. OpenDoor(9)
3. GoThrough(9)

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "doorNumber": 9},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "doorNumber": 9},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "doorNumber": 9}
  ]
}
```

This plan takes you directly from the HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2 using the most efficient path available according to the floor plan.
