Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. Let me start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections based on the image:

Room and Door Connections:
1. WC connects to Hall through D4
2. Hall connects to Douche through D2
3. Hall connects to Chambre 1 through D5
4. Hall connects to Cuisine through D6
5. Cellier connects to Cuisine through D3
6. Garages connects to Cellier through D1
7. Hall connects to Cuisine (lower instance) through D7

Now, let's create the navigation plan to go from WC to Cuisine:

Step 1: Start in WC
Step 2: Use D4 to enter Hall
Step 3: From Hall, use D6 to enter Cuisine

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from the WC to the Cuisine, using only the necessary doors (D4 and D6) and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
