Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the DOUCHE to the CELLIER.

Rooms and Doors:

1. DOUCHE: Connected to CUISINE via D4
2. CUISINE (large room): Connected to DOUCHE via D4, to CH. PARENTS via D3, to TERRASSE COUVERTE via D1, and to CELLIER via D2
3. CH. PARENTS: Connected to CUISINE via D3
4. TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE via D1
5. CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE via D2

Navigation Plan:

To go from DOUCHE to CELLIER, we need to pass through the CUISINE. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(D4)
2. OpenDoor(D4)
3. GoThrough(D4)
4. ApproachDoor(D2)
5. OpenDoor(D2)
6. GoThrough(D2)

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the DOUCHE to the CELLIER using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
