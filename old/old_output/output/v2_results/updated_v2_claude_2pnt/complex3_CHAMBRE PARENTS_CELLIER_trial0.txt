Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the CHAMBRE PARENTS to the CELLIER.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D8: Connects CHAMBRE PARENTS to HALL
2. D7: Connects HALL to BAINS
3. D6: Connects HALL to BUREAU
4. D5: Connects HALL to LINGERIE
5. D4: Connects HALL to WC
6. D3: Connects HALL to PORCHE
7. D2: Connects PORCHE to CELLIER
8. D1: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE
9. D11: Connects CELLIER to HALL

Navigation Plan:
To go from CHAMBRE PARENTS to CELLIER, we'll use the following path:
CHAMBRE PARENTS -> D8 -> HALL -> D3 -> PORCHE -> D2 -> CELLIER

Here's the step-by-step navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 8
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 8
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 8
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 2
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 2
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 2
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from CHAMBRE PARENTS to CELLIER, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
