Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects HALL to CELLIER
D2: Connects PORCHE to CELLIER
D3: Connects PORCHE to HALL
D4: Connects HALL to WC
D5: Connects HALL to LINGERIE
D6: Connects HALL to BUREAU
D7: Connects HALL to BAINS
D8: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE PARENTS
D9: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
D10: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
D11: Connects CELLIER to HALL

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in the HALL
2. Approach door D9
3. Open door D9
4. Go through door D9 to enter CHAMBRE ENFANT 2

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 9}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from the HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2, using only the necessary doors and actions.
