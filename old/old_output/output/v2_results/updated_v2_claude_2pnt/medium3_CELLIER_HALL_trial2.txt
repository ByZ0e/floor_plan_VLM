Certainly! I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections based on the floor plan, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects Garages to Cellier
2. D2: Connects Garages to Douche
3. D3: Connects Cellier to Cuisine
4. D4: Connects WC to Hall
5. D5: Connects Hall to Chambre 1
6. D6: Connects Cuisine to Hall
7. D7: Connects Cuisine to Hall

Step-by-step Solution:
1. Start in Cellier
2. Use D3 to enter Cuisine
3. Use D6 or D7 to enter Hall (final destination)

Now, I'll provide the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 6
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 6
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 6
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the Cellier to the Hall, using only the necessary doors (D3 and D6) to reach the destination. The plan avoids any unnecessary rooms or doors and ensures that each action is correct for traversal to the end goal.
