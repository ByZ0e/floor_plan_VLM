Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects SEJOUR to Porche
- D2: Connects CUISINE to Porche
- D3: Connects CUISINE to SEJOUR
- D4: Connects SEJOUR to DEGT
- D5: Connects CH.1 to DEGT
- D6: Connects CH.2 to DEGT
- D7: Connects BAINS to DEGT
- D8: Connects WC to DEGT

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in WC
2. ApproachDoor(8)
3. OpenDoor(8)
4. GoThrough(8) to enter DEGT
5. ApproachDoor(7)
6. OpenDoor(7)
7. GoThrough(7) to enter BAINS

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "WC",
  "end": "BAINS",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from the WC to the BAINS, using only the necessary doors (D8 and D7) to reach the destination.
