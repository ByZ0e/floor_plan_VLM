Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the GARAGE to the BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects GARAGE to HALL
- D2: Connects CHAMBRE1 to HALL
- D3: Connects HALL to WC
- D4: Connects HALL to BAINS
- D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE3
- D6: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE2
- D7: Connects CELLIER to HALL
- D8: Connects HALL to Porche

Now, I'll create a step-by-step navigation plan from the GARAGE to the BAINS:

1. ApproachDoor(1)
2. OpenDoor(1)
3. GoThrough(1)
4. ApproachDoor(4)
5. OpenDoor(4)
6. GoThrough(4)

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "doorNumber": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "doorNumber": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "doorNumber": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "doorNumber": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "doorNumber": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "doorNumber": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the GARAGE to the BAINS, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
