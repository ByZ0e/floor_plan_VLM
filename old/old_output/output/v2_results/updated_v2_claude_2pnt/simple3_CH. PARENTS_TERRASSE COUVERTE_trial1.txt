Thank you for providing the floor plan. Let me first list out the rooms and doors with their connections based on the image:

Room and Door Connections:
1. CH. PARENTS connects to CUISINE via D3
2. CUISINE connects to CELLIER via D2
3. CELLIER connects to another CUISINE area via D2
4. The other CUISINE area connects to TERRASSE COUVERTE via D1
5. DOUCHE connects to CUISINE via D4

Now, let's create a step-by-step navigation plan to get from CH. PARENTS to TERRASSE COUVERTE:

1. Start in CH. PARENTS
2. ApproachDoor(3)
3. OpenDoor(3)
4. GoThrough(3) to enter CUISINE
5. ApproachDoor(2)
6. OpenDoor(2)
7. GoThrough(2) to enter CELLIER
8. ApproachDoor(2)
9. OpenDoor(2)
10. GoThrough(2) to enter the other CUISINE area
11. ApproachDoor(1)
12. OpenDoor(1)
13. GoThrough(1) to reach TERRASSE COUVERTE

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(3)",
    "OpenDoor(3)",
    "GoThrough(3)",
    "ApproachDoor(2)",
    "OpenDoor(2)",
    "GoThrough(2)",
    "ApproachDoor(2)",
    "OpenDoor(2)",
    "GoThrough(2)",
    "ApproachDoor(1)",
    "OpenDoor(1)",
    "GoThrough(1)"
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from CH. PARENTS to TERRASSE COUVERTE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
