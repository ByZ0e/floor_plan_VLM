Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms, doors, and their connections, then provide you with a detailed navigation plan to go from CH.1 to CH.2.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

Rooms:
- CH.1
- CH.2
- CH.3
- SEJOUR (multiple instances)
- CUISINE

Doors and their connections:
D1: Connects CH.3 to SEJOUR
D2: Connects CH.2 to SEJOUR
D3: Connects CH.2 to SEJOUR
D4: Connects CH.1 to SEJOUR
D5: Connects CUISINE to SEJOUR
D6: Connects CUISINE to SEJOUR

Now, let's create a step-by-step navigation plan from CH.1 to CH.2:

1. Start in CH.1
2. ApproachDoor(D4)
3. OpenDoor(D4)
4. GoThrough(D4) - Now in SEJOUR
5. ApproachDoor(D3)
6. OpenDoor(D3)
7. GoThrough(D3) - Now in CH.2

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CH.1",
  "end": "CH.2",
  "actions": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from CH.1 to CH.2, using only the necessary doors (D4 and D3) and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors. The plan takes into account that doors close after each GoThrough action, so each door needs to be approached and opened before going through.
