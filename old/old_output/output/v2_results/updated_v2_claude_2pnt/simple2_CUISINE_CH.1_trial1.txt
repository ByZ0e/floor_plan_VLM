Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the CUISINE to CH.1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects BAINS to HALL
2. D2 connects CH.1 to HALL
3. D3 connects CH.2 to HALL
4. D4 connects GARAGE to CUISINE
5. D5 connects CUISINE to HALL

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in CUISINE
2. ApproachDoor(D5)
3. OpenDoor(D5)
4. GoThrough(D5) to enter HALL
5. ApproachDoor(D2)
6. OpenDoor(D2)
7. GoThrough(D2) to enter CH.1

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CUISINE",
  "end": "CH.1",
  "actions": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the CUISINE to CH.1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
