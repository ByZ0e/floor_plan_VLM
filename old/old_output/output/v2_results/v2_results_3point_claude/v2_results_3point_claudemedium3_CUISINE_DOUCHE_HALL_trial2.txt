Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects GARAGES to CELLIER
D2: Connects GARAGES to DOUCHE
D3: Connects CELLIER to CUISINE
D4: Connects WC to HALL
D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
D6: Connects CUISINE to HALL
D7: Connects CUISINE to HALL

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in CUISINE
2. Use D6 to go from CUISINE to HALL
3. Use D2 to go from HALL to DOUCHE
4. Use D2 to return from DOUCHE to HALL

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the CUISINE to the DOUCHE and then back to the HALL, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
