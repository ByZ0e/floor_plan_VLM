Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms, doors, and connections, then provide a navigation plan as requested.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

Rooms:
- CH.3
- CH.2
- CH.1
- SEJOUR (multiple instances, representing a larger common area)
- CUISINE

Doors and their connections:
D1: Connects CH.3 to SEJOUR
D2: Connects CH.3 to CH.2
D3: Connects CH.2 to SEJOUR
D4: Connects CH.1 to SEJOUR
D5: Connects CUISINE to SEJOUR
D6: Connects CUISINE to SEJOUR

Now, I'll provide the step-by-step navigation plan from CH.3 to CH.2, and then to CH.1:

1. Start in CH.3
2. ApproachDoor(D2)
3. OpenDoor(D2)
4. GoThrough(D2) - Now in CH.2
5. ApproachDoor(D3)
6. OpenDoor(D3)
7. GoThrough(D3) - Now in SEJOUR
8. ApproachDoor(D4)
9. OpenDoor(D4)
10. GoThrough(D4) - Now in CH.1

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides an efficient route from CH.3 to CH.1, passing through CH.2 as required. It uses only the necessary doors and avoids any unnecessary rooms or detours.
