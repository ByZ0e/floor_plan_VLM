Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects CELLIER and HALL
D2: Connects BAINS and HALL
D3: Connects WC and HALL
D4: Connects CHAMBRE 1 and HALL
D5: Connects CHAMBRE 2 and HALL
D6: Connects PORCHE and HALL
D7: Connects CUISINE and HALL
D8: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Connects CELLIER and GARAGE

Navigation Plan:
Starting in CUISINE, the path to CELLIER and then to GARAGE would be:

1. From CUISINE to CELLIER:
   - ApproachDoor(D7)
   - OpenDoor(D7)
   - GoThrough(D7)
   - ApproachDoor(D1)
   - OpenDoor(D1)
   - GoThrough(D1)

2. From CELLIER to GARAGE:
   - ApproachDoor(D9)
   - OpenDoor(D9)
   - GoThrough(D9)

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the CUISINE to the CELLIER and then to the GARAGE using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
