Thank you for providing the floor plan image and the navigation task. Let me first list out the rooms and their door connections based on the image:

Room and Door Connections:
1. CHAMBRE 3 - connected to HALL via D5
2. BAINS - connected to HALL via D4
3. CHAMBRE 1 - connected to HALL via D2
4. CHAMBRE 2 - connected to HALL via D6
5. GARAGE - connected to HALL via D1
6. CELLIER - connected to HALL via D7
7. Porche - connected to HALL via D8
8. WC - connected to HALL via D3

Now, let's create a step-by-step navigation plan based on these connections:

1. Start in CHAMBRE 3
2. Exit CHAMBRE 3 to HALL through D5
3. Move through HALL to BAINS
4. Enter BAINS through D4
5. Exit BAINS to HALL through D4

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CHAMBRE 3 to BAINS and then to HALL, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
