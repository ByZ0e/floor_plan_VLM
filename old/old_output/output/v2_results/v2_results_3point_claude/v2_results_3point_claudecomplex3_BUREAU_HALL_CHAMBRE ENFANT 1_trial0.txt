Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and their door connections, then provide a navigation plan based on your requirements.

Room and Door Connections:
1. BUREAU connects to HALL via D6
2. HALL connects to BAINS via D7
3. HALL connects to CHAMBRE PARENTS via D8
4. HALL connects to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2 via D9
5. HALL connects to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 via D10
6. LINGERIE connects to HALL via D5
7. WC connects to HALL via D4
8. CELLIER connects to HALL via D3
9. CELLIER connects to PORCHE via D2
10. CELLIER connects to GARAGE via D1
11. CELLIER connects to HALL via D11

Based on these connections, here's the step-by-step navigation plan to go from BUREAU to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1:

1. Start in BUREAU
2. ApproachDoor(D6)
3. OpenDoor(D6)
4. GoThrough(D6) to enter HALL
5. ApproachDoor(D10)
6. OpenDoor(D10)
7. GoThrough(D10) to enter CHAMBRE ENFANT 1

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D10"}
  ]
}
```

This path efficiently navigates from the BUREAU to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1 using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
