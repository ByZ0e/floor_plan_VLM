Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a detailed navigation plan for your route from CH.1 to CH.2 and finally to BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects HALL to BAINS
- D2: Connects CH.1 to HALL
- D3: Connects CH.2 to HALL
- D4: Connects GARAGE to CUISINE
- D5: Connects CUISINE to HALL

Now, let's create the navigation plan based on these connections:

Step 1: From CH.1 to CH.2
1. ApproachDoor(2)
2. OpenDoor(2)
3. GoThrough(2)
4. ApproachDoor(3)
5. OpenDoor(3)
6. GoThrough(3)

Step 2: From CH.2 to BAINS
7. ApproachDoor(3)
8. OpenDoor(3)
9. GoThrough(3)
10. ApproachDoor(1)
11. OpenDoor(1)
12. GoThrough(1)

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently guides you from CH.1 to CH.2 and finally to BAINS, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
