Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
D2: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to HALL
D3: Connects BAINS to HALL
D4: Connects WC to HALL
D5: Connects PORCHE to HALL
D6: Connects CHAMBRE 1 to HALL
D7: Connects CUISINE to HALL
D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in CHAMBRE 2
2. Use D2 to enter HALL
3. Use D9 to enter GARAGE
4. Use D9 again to enter CELLIER

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CHAMBRE 2 to GARAGE and then to CELLIER using only the necessary doors along the path.
