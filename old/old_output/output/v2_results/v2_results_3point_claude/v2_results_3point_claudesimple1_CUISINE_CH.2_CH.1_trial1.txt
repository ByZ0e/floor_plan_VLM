Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects SEJOUR to CH.3
- D2: Connects CH.3 to CH.2
- D3: Connects CH.2 to SEJOUR
- D4: Connects SEJOUR to CH.1
- D5: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
- D6: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in CUISINE
2. ApproachDoor(D5)
3. OpenDoor(D5)
4. GoThrough(D5) to enter SEJOUR
5. ApproachDoor(D3)
6. OpenDoor(D3)
7. GoThrough(D3) to enter CH.2
8. ApproachDoor(D3)
9. OpenDoor(D3)
10. GoThrough(D3) to enter SEJOUR
11. ApproachDoor(D4)
12. OpenDoor(D4)
13. GoThrough(D4) to enter CH.1

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CUISINE to CH.2 and then to CH.1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
