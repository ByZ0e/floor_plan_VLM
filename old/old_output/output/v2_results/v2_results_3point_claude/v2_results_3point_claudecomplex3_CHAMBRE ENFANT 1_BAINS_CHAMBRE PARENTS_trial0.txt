Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects Garage and Cellier
2. D2: Connects Cellier and Porche
3. D3: Connects Porche and Hall
4. D4: Connects Hall and WC
5. D5: Connects Hall and Lingerie
6. D6: Connects Hall and Bureau
7. D7: Connects Hall and Bains
8. D8: Connects Hall and Chambre Parents
9. D9: Connects Hall and Chambre Enfant 2
10. D10: Connects Hall and Chambre Enfant 1
11. D11: Connects Cellier and Hall

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in Chambre Enfant 1
2. ApproachDoor(D10)
3. OpenDoor(D10)
4. GoThrough(D10) to enter Hall
5. ApproachDoor(D7)
6. OpenDoor(D7)
7. GoThrough(D7) to enter Bains
8. ApproachDoor(D7)
9. OpenDoor(D7)
10. GoThrough(D7) to enter Hall
11. ApproachDoor(D8)
12. OpenDoor(D8)
13. GoThrough(D8) to enter Chambre Parents

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D10"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from Chambre Enfant 1 to Bains and then to Chambre Parents, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
