Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects Garage and Cellier
D2: Connects Cellier and Porche
D3: Connects Porche and Hall
D4: Connects Hall and WC
D5: Connects Hall and Lingerie
D6: Connects Hall and Bureau
D7: Connects Hall and Bains
D8: Connects Hall and Chambre Parents
D9: Connects Hall and Chambre Enfant 2
D10: Connects Hall and Chambre Enfant 1
D11: Connects Cellier and Hall

Navigation Plan:
Starting from Chambre Enfant 1, we need to go to Bains and then to Chambre Parents. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. From Chambre Enfant 1 to Bains:
   - ApproachDoor(10)
   - OpenDoor(10)
   - GoThrough(10)
   - ApproachDoor(7)
   - OpenDoor(7)
   - GoThrough(7)

2. From Bains to Chambre Parents:
   - ApproachDoor(7)
   - OpenDoor(7)
   - GoThrough(7)
   - ApproachDoor(8)
   - OpenDoor(8)
   - GoThrough(8)

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 10},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from Chambre Enfant 1 to Bains and then to Chambre Parents, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
