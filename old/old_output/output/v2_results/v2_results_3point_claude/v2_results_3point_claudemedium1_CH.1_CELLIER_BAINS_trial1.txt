Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms, doors, and their connections, then provide you with a detailed navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
- CH.1 connects to SEJOUR through D5
- SEJOUR connects to CUISINE through D3
- SEJOUR connects to DEGT through D4
- DEGT connects to CH.2 through D6
- DEGT connects to WC through D8
- DEGT connects to BAINS through D7
- CUISINE connects to CELLIER through D2
- CELLIER connects to Porche through D1

Now, I'll create a step-by-step navigation plan from CH.1 to CELLIER, and then to BAINS:

1. Start in CH.1
2. ApproachDoor(D5)
3. OpenDoor(D5)
4. GoThrough(D5) - Now in SEJOUR
5. ApproachDoor(D3)
6. OpenDoor(D3)
7. GoThrough(D3) - Now in CUISINE
8. ApproachDoor(D2)
9. OpenDoor(D2)
10. GoThrough(D2) - Now in CELLIER
11. ApproachDoor(D2)
12. OpenDoor(D2)
13. GoThrough(D2) - Now back in CUISINE
14. ApproachDoor(D3)
15. OpenDoor(D3)
16. GoThrough(D3) - Now in SEJOUR
17. ApproachDoor(D4)
18. OpenDoor(D4)
19. GoThrough(D4) - Now in DEGT
20. ApproachDoor(D7)
21. OpenDoor(D7)
22. GoThrough(D7) - Now in BAINS

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CH.1 to CELLIER and then to BAINS, using only the necessary doors and following the most direct path based on the provided floor plan.
