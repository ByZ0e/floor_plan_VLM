Certainly! I'll analyze the floor plan, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a detailed navigation plan for your task.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

Rooms:
- CH.1
- CH.2
- BAINS
- GARAGE
- CUISINE
- HALL (multiple instances)

Doors:
- D1: Connects HALL to BAINS
- D2: Connects CH.1 to HALL
- D3: Connects CH.2 to HALL
- D4: Connects GARAGE to CUISINE
- D5: Connects CUISINE to HALL

Navigation Plan:

Starting from CH.2, we need to go through HALL to reach GARAGE. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(D3)
2. OpenDoor(D3)
3. GoThrough(D3)
4. ApproachDoor(D4)
5. OpenDoor(D4)
6. GoThrough(D4)

This plan takes you from CH.2 to HALL, and then from HALL to GARAGE using the necessary doors.

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
  ]
}
```

This plan ensures that you follow the most efficient path from CH.2 to GARAGE, passing through HALL as required, and using only the necessary doors for traversal.
