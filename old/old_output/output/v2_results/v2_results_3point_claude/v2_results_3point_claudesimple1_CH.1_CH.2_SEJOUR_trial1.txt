Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1 connects CH.3 and SEJOUR
- D2 connects CH.3 and CH.2
- D3 connects CH.2 and SEJOUR
- D4 connects CH.1 and SEJOUR
- D5 connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
- D6 connects SEJOUR and CUISINE

Now, let's create the navigation plan from CH.1 to CH.2, and then to SEJOUR:

Step 1: CH.1 to CH.2
We need to go through SEJOUR to reach CH.2 from CH.1.

Step 2: CH.2 to SEJOUR
We can directly go from CH.2 to SEJOUR.

Based on these steps, here's the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 3
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates you from CH.1 to CH.2 and then to SEJOUR, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
