Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan based on those connections.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects BAINS to HALL
- D2: Connects CH.1 to HALL
- D3: Connects CH.2 to HALL
- D4: Connects GARAGE to CUISINE
- D5: Connects CUISINE to HALL

Navigation Plan:

1. Start in BAINS
2. ApproachDoor(D1)
3. OpenDoor(D1)
4. GoThrough(D1) to enter HALL
5. ApproachDoor(D5)
6. OpenDoor(D5)
7. GoThrough(D5) to enter CUISINE
8. ApproachDoor(D5)
9. OpenDoor(D5)
10. GoThrough(D5) to enter HALL
11. ApproachDoor(D2)
12. OpenDoor(D2)
13. GoThrough(D2) to enter CH.1

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(D1)",
    "OpenDoor(D1)",
    "GoThrough(D1)",
    "ApproachDoor(D5)",
    "OpenDoor(D5)",
    "GoThrough(D5)",
    "ApproachDoor(D5)",
    "OpenDoor(D5)",
    "GoThrough(D5)",
    "ApproachDoor(D2)",
    "OpenDoor(D2)",
    "GoThrough(D2)"
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from BAINS to CUISINE and then to CH.1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
