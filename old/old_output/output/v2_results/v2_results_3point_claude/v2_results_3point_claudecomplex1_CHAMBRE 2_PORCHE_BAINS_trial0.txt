Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan for your robot to move from CHAMBRE 2 to PORCHE and finally to BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects CELLIER and HALL
2. D2: Connects BAINS and HALL
3. D3: Connects WC and HALL
4. D4: Connects CHAMBRE 1 and HALL
5. D5: Connects CHAMBRE 2 and HALL
6. D6: Connects PORCHE and HALL
7. D7: Connects CUISINE and HALL
8. D8: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
9. D9: Connects CELLIER and GARAGE

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in CHAMBRE 2
2. Use D5 to enter HALL
3. Move through HALL to D6
4. Use D6 to enter PORCHE
5. Return to HALL through D6
6. Move through HALL to D2
7. Use D2 to enter BAINS

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates the robot from CHAMBRE 2 to PORCHE and finally to BAINS, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
