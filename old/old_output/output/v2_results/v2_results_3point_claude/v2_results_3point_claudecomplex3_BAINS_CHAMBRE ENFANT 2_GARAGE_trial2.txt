Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the connections and provide a navigation plan as requested.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER
D2: Connects CELLIER to PORCHE
D3: Connects PORCHE to HALL
D4: Connects HALL to WC
D5: Connects HALL to LINGERIE
D6: Connects HALL to BUREAU
D7: Connects HALL to BAINS
D8: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE PARENTS
D9: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
D10: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
D11: Connects CELLIER to HALL

Now, I'll provide the step-by-step navigation plan from BAINS to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2, and finally to GARAGE:

Step 1: BAINS to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
1. ApproachDoor(D7)
2. OpenDoor(D7)
3. GoThrough(D7)
4. ApproachDoor(D9)
5. OpenDoor(D9)
6. GoThrough(D9)

Step 2: CHAMBRE ENFANT 2 to GARAGE
7. ApproachDoor(D9)
8. OpenDoor(D9)
9. GoThrough(D9)
10. ApproachDoor(D11)
11. OpenDoor(D11)
12. GoThrough(D11)
13. ApproachDoor(D1)
14. OpenDoor(D1)
15. GoThrough(D1)

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from BAINS to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2, and then to GARAGE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
