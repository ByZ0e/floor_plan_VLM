Thank you for providing the floor plan. Let me analyze the rooms, doors, and their connections, then provide you with a detailed navigation plan.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects GARAGE and HALL
D2: Connects CHAMBRE 1 and HALL
D3: Connects HALL and WC
D4: Connects HALL and BAINS
D5: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 3
D6: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 2
D7: Connects HALL and CELLIER
D8: Connects HALL and Porche

Step-by-step solution:

1. Start in the HALL
2. To reach CHAMBRE 1:
   - ApproachDoor(D2)
   - OpenDoor(D2)
   - GoThrough(D2)
3. To reach CHAMBRE 2 from CHAMBRE 1:
   - ApproachDoor(D2)
   - OpenDoor(D2)
   - GoThrough(D2)
   - ApproachDoor(D6)
   - OpenDoor(D6)
   - GoThrough(D6)

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan will efficiently guide you from the HALL to CHAMBRE 1, and then to CHAMBRE 2, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
