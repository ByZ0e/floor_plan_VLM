Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects BAINS to HALL
D2: Connects CH.1 to HALL
D3: Connects CH.2 to HALL
D4: Connects GARAGE to CUISINE
D5: Connects CUISINE to HALL

Navigation Plan:
To go from BAINS to CUISINE, then to CH.1, we'll use the following sequence:

1. From BAINS to CUISINE:
   - ApproachDoor(D1)
   - OpenDoor(D1)
   - GoThrough(D1)
   - ApproachDoor(D5)
   - OpenDoor(D5)
   - GoThrough(D5)

2. From CUISINE to CH.1:
   - ApproachDoor(D5)
   - OpenDoor(D5)
   - GoThrough(D5)
   - ApproachDoor(D2)
   - OpenDoor(D2)
   - GoThrough(D2)

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from BAINS to CUISINE and then to CH.1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
