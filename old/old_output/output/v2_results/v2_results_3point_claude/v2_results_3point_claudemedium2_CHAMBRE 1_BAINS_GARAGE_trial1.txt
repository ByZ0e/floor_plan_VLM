Certainly! I'll start by providing a clear list of rooms and doors with their connections based on the floor plan image, then create a detailed navigation plan as requested.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

1. D1: Connects GARAGE to HALL
2. D2: Connects CHAMBRE 1 to HALL
3. D3: Connects HALL to WC
4. D4: Connects HALL to BAINS
5. D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 3
6. D6: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 2
7. D7: Connects HALL to CELLIER
8. D8: Connects HALL to Porche (outside)

Now, let's create the step-by-step navigation plan:

Step 1: From CHAMBRE 1 to BAINS
1. ApproachDoor(D2)
2. OpenDoor(D2)
3. GoThrough(D2)
4. ApproachDoor(D4)
5. OpenDoor(D4)
6. GoThrough(D4)

Step 2: From BAINS to GARAGE
1. ApproachDoor(D4)
2. OpenDoor(D4)
3. GoThrough(D4)
4. ApproachDoor(D1)
5. OpenDoor(D1)
6. GoThrough(D1)

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan efficiently guides you from CHAMBRE 1 to BAINS and then to GARAGE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
