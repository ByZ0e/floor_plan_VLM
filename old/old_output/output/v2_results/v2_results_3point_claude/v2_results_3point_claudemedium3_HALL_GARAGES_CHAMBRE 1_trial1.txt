Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms, doors, and their connections, then provide a navigation plan as requested.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects GARAGES and CELLIER
D2: Connects GARAGES and DOUCHE
D3: Connects CELLIER and CUISINE
D4: Connects HALL and WC
D5: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 1
D6: Connects HALL and CUISINE
D7: Connects HALL and CUISINE (second instance)

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in HALL
2. Go to CUISINE through D6
3. Go to CELLIER through D3
4. Go to GARAGES through D1
5. Return to HALL through D6
6. Go to CHAMBRE 1 through D5

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the HALL to GARAGES and then to CHAMBRE 1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
