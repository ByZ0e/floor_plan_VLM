Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll first list out the rooms and door connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects SEJOUR and Porche
2. D2 connects CUISINE and Porche
3. D3 connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
4. D4 connects SEJOUR and DEGT
5. D5 connects CH.1 and DEGT
6. D6 connects CH.2 and DEGT
7. D7 connects BAINS and DEGT
8. D8 connects WC and DEGT

Now, for the navigation task from DEGT to CH.2, then to CH.1:

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in DEGT
2. To reach CH.2:
   - ApproachDoor(D6)
   - OpenDoor(D6)
   - GoThrough(D6)
3. From CH.2 back to DEGT:
   - ApproachDoor(D6)
   - OpenDoor(D6)
   - GoThrough(D6)
4. From DEGT to CH.1:
   - ApproachDoor(D5)
   - OpenDoor(D5)
   - GoThrough(D5)

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan efficiently guides you from DEGT to CH.2, then back to DEGT, and finally to CH.1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
