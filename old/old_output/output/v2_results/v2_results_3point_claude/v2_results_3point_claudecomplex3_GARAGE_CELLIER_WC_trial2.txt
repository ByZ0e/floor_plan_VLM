Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the relevant room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan as requested.

Relevant Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects Garage to Cellier
- D3: Connects Porche to Hall
- D4: Connects Hall to WC

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
1. Start in Garage
2. Use D1 to enter Cellier
3. Exit Cellier through D1 to Garage
4. Go through Porche using D3 to enter Hall
5. From Hall, use D4 to reach WC

Now, I'll provide the detailed navigation plan in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the Garage to the Cellier and then to the WC, using only the necessary doors and following the layout of the floor plan.
