Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects GARAGES and CELLIER
D2: Connects GARAGES and DOUCHE
D3: Connects CELLIER and CUISINE
D4: Connects WC and HALL
D5: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 1
D6: Connects CUISINE and HALL
D7: Connects CUISINE and HALL

Step-by-step solution for the navigation task:
1. Start in CUISINE
2. Use D6 to go from CUISINE to HALL
3. Use D2 to go from HALL to DOUCHE
4. Use D2 to return from DOUCHE to HALL (final destination)

Here's the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D6"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D6"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D6"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D2"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D2"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D2"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D2"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D2"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D2"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CUISINE to DOUCHE and then to HALL, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
