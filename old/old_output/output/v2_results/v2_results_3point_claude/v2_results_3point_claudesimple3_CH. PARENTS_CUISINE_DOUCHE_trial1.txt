Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan as requested.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

Rooms:
1. CH. PARENTS (two connected rooms)
2. CUISINE (multiple connected areas labeled as CUISINE)
3. DOUCHE
4. CELLIER
5. TERRASSE COUVERTE

Doors:
D1: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE and CUISINE
D2: Connects CUISINE and CELLIER
D3: Connects CUISINE and CH. PARENTS
D4: Connects CH. PARENTS and DOUCHE

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan to go from CH. PARENTS to CUISINE, then to DOUCHE:

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CH. PARENTS
2. Use D3 to enter CUISINE
3. Cross CUISINE
4. Use D4 to enter DOUCHE

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "doorNumber": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "doorNumber": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "doorNumber": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "doorNumber": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "doorNumber": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "doorNumber": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CH. PARENTS to CUISINE, and then to DOUCHE, using only the necessary doors (D3 and D4) without any unnecessary detours.
