Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. Let's start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections based on the image:

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects CELLIER and HALL
- D2: Connects BAINS and HALL
- D3: Connects WC and HALL
- D4: Connects CHAMBRE 1 and HALL
- D5: Connects CHAMBRE 2 and HALL
- D6: Connects PORCHE and HALL
- D7: Connects CUISINE and HALL
- D8: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
- D9: Connects CELLIER and GARAGE

Now, let's create the navigation plan to go from CUISINE to PORCHE, and then to BAINS:

Step 1: CUISINE to PORCHE
1. ApproachDoor(D7)
2. OpenDoor(D7)
3. GoThrough(D7)
4. ApproachDoor(D6)
5. OpenDoor(D6)
6. GoThrough(D6)

Step 2: PORCHE to BAINS
1. ApproachDoor(D6)
2. OpenDoor(D6)
3. GoThrough(D6)
4. ApproachDoor(D2)
5. OpenDoor(D2)
6. GoThrough(D2)

Now, let's combine these steps into a single, efficient navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CUISINE to PORCHE and then to BAINS using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
