Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:
- D1: Connects SEJOUR to Porche
- D2: Connects CUISINE to Porche
- D3: Connects CUISINE to SEJOUR
- D4: Connects SEJOUR to DEGT
- D5: Connects CH.1 to DEGT
- D6: Connects CH.2 to DEGT
- D7: Connects BAINS to DEGT
- D8: Connects WC to DEGT

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in DEGT
2. Go to CH.2:
   - ApproachDoor(D6)
   - OpenDoor(D6)
   - GoThrough(D6)
3. Return to DEGT:
   - ApproachDoor(D6)
   - OpenDoor(D6)
   - GoThrough(D6)
4. Go to CH.1:
   - ApproachDoor(D5)
   - OpenDoor(D5)
   - GoThrough(D5)

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from DEGT to CH.2, then back to DEGT, and finally to CH.1, using only the necessary doors and actions.
