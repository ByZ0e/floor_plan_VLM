Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects TERRASSE COUVERTE to CUISINE
- D2: Connects CUISINE to CELLIER
- D3: Connects CUISINE to CH. PARENTS
- D4: Connects CH. PARENTS to DOUCHE

Now, I'll create a step-by-step navigation plan based on these connections:

1. Start in TERRASSE COUVERTE
2. Use D1 to enter CUISINE
3. Use D3 to enter CH. PARENTS
4. Use D4 to reach DOUCHE

Here's the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 4
    }
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan will efficiently guide you from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to the DOUCHE, passing through the required CH. PARENTS room, using only the necessary doors along the way.
