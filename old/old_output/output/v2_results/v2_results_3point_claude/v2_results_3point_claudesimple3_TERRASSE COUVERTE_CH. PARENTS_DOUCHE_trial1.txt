Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
1. TERRASSE COUVERTE - connected to CUISINE via D1
2. CUISINE - connected to TERRASSE COUVERTE via D1, to CELLIER via D2, and to CH. PARENTS via D3
3. CELLIER - connected to CUISINE via D2
4. CH. PARENTS - connected to CUISINE via D3, and to DOUCHE via D4
5. DOUCHE - connected to CH. PARENTS via D4

Now, let's create the navigation plan:

Step 1: From TERRASSE COUVERTE to CH. PARENTS
- ApproachDoor(D1)
- OpenDoor(D1)
- GoThrough(D1)
- ApproachDoor(D3)
- OpenDoor(D3)
- GoThrough(D3)

Step 2: From CH. PARENTS to DOUCHE
- ApproachDoor(D4)
- OpenDoor(D4)
- GoThrough(D4)

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates you from the TERRASSE COUVERTE to the DOUCHE, passing through the necessary rooms and doors without any unnecessary detours.
