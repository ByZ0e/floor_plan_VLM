Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan based on these connections.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D6: Connects BUREAU and BAINS
2. D7: Connects BAINS and HALL (near CHAMBRE PARENTS)
3. D8: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE PARENTS
4. D9: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
5. D10: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
6. D5: Connects HALL and BUREAU
7. D4: Connects HALL and WC
8. D3: Connects HALL and PORCHE
9. D2: Connects PORCHE and CELLIER
10. D1: Connects CELLIER and GARAGE
11. D11: Connects CELLIER and HALL (near GARAGE)

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in BAINS
2. Go to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
3. Go to GARAGE

Based on these connections, here's the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 9},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 9},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from BAINS to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2, and then to GARAGE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
