Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects SEJOUR and PORCHE
D2: Connects CUISINE and PORCHE
D3: Connects CUISINE and SEJOUR
D4: Connects SEJOUR and DEGT
D5: Connects CH.1 and DEGT
D6: Connects CH.2 and DEGT
D7: Connects BAINS and DEGT
D8: Connects WC and DEGT

Now, let's create the navigation plan from DEGT to PORCHE, and then to CUISINE:

Step 1: From DEGT to PORCHE
- ApproachDoor(D4)
- OpenDoor(D4)
- GoThrough(D4)
- ApproachDoor(D1)
- OpenDoor(D1)
- GoThrough(D1)

Step 2: From PORCHE to CUISINE
- ApproachDoor(D2)
- OpenDoor(D2)
- GoThrough(D2)

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from DEGT to PORCHE and then to CUISINE using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or actions.
