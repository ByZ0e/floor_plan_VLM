Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. Let's start by explicitly listing the rooms and doors with their connections based on the image:

Room and Door Connections:
- D1 connects SEJOUR and Porche
- D2 connects CUISINE and Porche
- D3 connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
- D4 connects SEJOUR and DEGT
- D5 connects CH.1 and DEGT
- D6 connects CH.2 and DEGT
- D7 connects BAINS and DEGT
- D8 connects WC and DEGT

Now, let's create a step-by-step navigation plan to go from CH.1 to CELLIER, and then to BAINS:

1. Start in CH.1
2. Use D5 to enter DEGT
3. Use D4 to enter SEJOUR
4. Use D3 to enter CUISINE
5. Use D2 to enter Porche
6. Use D2 again to enter CUISINE (as CELLIER is only accessible through CUISINE)
7. From CUISINE, go back through D2 to Porche
8. Go through D2 again to CUISINE
9. Use D3 to enter SEJOUR
10. Use D4 to enter DEGT
11. Use D7 to reach BAINS

Now, let's translate this into the required action sequence in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan will efficiently guide you from CH.1 to CELLIER (through CUISINE) and finally to BAINS, using only the necessary doors and following the layout of the floor plan.
