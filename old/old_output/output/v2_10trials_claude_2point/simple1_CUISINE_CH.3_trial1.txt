Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the CUISINE to CH.3.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects SEJOUR to CH.3
2. D2 connects CH.2 to CH.3
3. D3 connects CH.2 to SEJOUR
4. D4 connects CH.1 to SEJOUR
5. D5 connects CUISINE to SEJOUR
6. D6 connects CUISINE to SEJOUR

Now, let's create the navigation plan:

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CUISINE
2. Use D5 to enter SEJOUR
3. Cross SEJOUR
4. Use D1 to enter CH.3

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the CUISINE to CH.3, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
