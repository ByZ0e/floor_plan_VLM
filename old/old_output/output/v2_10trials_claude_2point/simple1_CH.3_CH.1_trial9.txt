Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from CH.3 to CH.1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects CH.3 to SEJOUR
2. D2: Connects CH.2 to SEJOUR
3. D3: Connects CH.2 to SEJOUR
4. D4: Connects CH.1 to SEJOUR
5. D5: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
6. D6: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE

Now, let's create the navigation plan to go from CH.3 to CH.1:

Step 1: Exit CH.3 through D1 to enter SEJOUR
Step 2: Cross SEJOUR to reach D4
Step 3: Enter CH.1 through D4

Here's the detailed action plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "doorNumber": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "doorNumber": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "doorNumber": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "doorNumber": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "doorNumber": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "doorNumber": 4
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct route from CH.3 to CH.1, using only the necessary doors (D1 and D4) and passing through the SEJOUR area. The plan avoids unnecessary rooms and doors, ensuring an efficient path to the destination.
