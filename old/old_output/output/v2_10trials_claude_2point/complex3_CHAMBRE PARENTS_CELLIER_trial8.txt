Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from CHAMBRE PARENTS to CELLIER.

Room and Door Connections:
- D8: Connects CHAMBRE PARENTS to HALL
- D7: Connects HALL to BAINS
- D6: Connects HALL to BUREAU
- D5: Connects HALL to LINGERIE
- D4: Connects HALL to WC
- D3: Connects HALL to PORCHE
- D2: Connects PORCHE to CELLIER
- D1: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE
- D9: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
- D10: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
- D11: Connects HALL to CELLIER

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in CHAMBRE PARENTS
2. ApproachDoor(D8)
3. OpenDoor(D8)
4. GoThrough(D8) to enter HALL
5. ApproachDoor(D11)
6. OpenDoor(D11)
7. GoThrough(D11) to enter CELLIER

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D11"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from CHAMBRE PARENTS to CELLIER using only the necessary doors.
