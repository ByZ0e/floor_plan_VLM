Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from CHAMBRE 1 to the HALL.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER
- D2: Connects CHAMBRE 1 and HALL
- D3: Connects HALL and WC
- D4: Connects HALL and BAINS
- D5: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 3
- D6: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 2
- D7: Connects CELLIER and HALL
- D8: Connects HALL and Porche

Navigation Plan:
To go from CHAMBRE 1 to HALL, we only need to use one door: D2.

Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(2)
2. OpenDoor(2)
3. GoThrough(2)

Now, I'll provide the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CHAMBRE 1",
  "end": "HALL",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from CHAMBRE 1 to HALL, using only the necessary door (D2) to complete the navigation task.
