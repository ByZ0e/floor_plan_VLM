Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the connections and provide a navigation plan as requested.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects Cellier to Hall
D2: Connects Chambre 2 to Hall
D3: Connects Hall to Bains
D4: Connects Hall to WC
D5: Connects Chambre 2 to Porche
D6: Connects Hall to Chambre 1
D7: Connects Hall to Cuisine
D8: Connects Cuisine to Terrasse Couverte
D9: Connects Garage to Cellier

Step-by-step solution:

1. Start in Chambre 2
2. Use D2 to enter the Hall
3. From the Hall, use D4 to enter the WC

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D2"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D2"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D2"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D4"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from Chambre 2 to the WC, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
