Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and their door connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from BAINS to TERRASSE COUVERTE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. BAINS: D2
2. WC: D3
3. CELLIER: D1, D9
4. GARAGE: D9
5. CHAMBRE 2: D5
6. CHAMBRE 1: D4
7. HALL: D1, D2, D3, D4, D5, D6, D7
8. PORCHE: D6
9. CUISINE: D7, D8
10. TERRASSE COUVERTE: D8

Navigation Plan:
To get from BAINS to TERRASSE COUVERTE, we need to go through the following sequence:
BAINS -> HALL -> CUISINE -> TERRASSE COUVERTE

Here's the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from BAINS to TERRASSE COUVERTE using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
