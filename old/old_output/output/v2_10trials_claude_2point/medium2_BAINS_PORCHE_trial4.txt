Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from BAINS to PORCHE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects GARAGE to HALL
2. D2: Connects CHAMBRE1 to HALL
3. D3: Connects HALL to WC
4. D4: Connects BAINS to HALL
5. D5: Connects CHAMBRE3 to HALL
6. D6: Connects CHAMBRE2 to HALL
7. D7: Connects CELLIER to HALL
8. D8: Connects HALL to PORCHE

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
1. Start in BAINS
2. ApproachDoor(D4)
3. OpenDoor(D4)
4. GoThrough(D4) to enter HALL
5. ApproachDoor(D8)
6. OpenDoor(D8)
7. GoThrough(D8) to reach PORCHE

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "BAINS",
  "end": "PORCHE",
  "actions": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from BAINS to PORCHE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
