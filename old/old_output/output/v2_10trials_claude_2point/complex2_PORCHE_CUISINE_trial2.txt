Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the PORCHE to the CUISINE.

Explicit Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
D2: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to HALL
D3: Connects BAINS to HALL
D4: Connects WC to HALL
D5: Connects PORCHE to HALL
D6: Connects CHAMBRE 1 to HALL
D7: Connects CUISINE to HALL
D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in PORCHE
2. Use D5 to enter HALL
3. Use D7 to enter CUISINE

Based on this analysis, here's the efficient navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D5"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D5"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D5"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D7"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D7"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D7"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from the PORCHE to the CUISINE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
