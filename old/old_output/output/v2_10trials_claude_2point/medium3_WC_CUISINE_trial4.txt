Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from the WC to the CUISINE.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects GARAGES to CELLIER
- D2: Connects GARAGES to DOUCHE
- D3: Connects CELLIER to CUISINE
- D4: Connects WC to HALL
- D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
- D6: Connects HALL to CUISINE
- D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE (second door)

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in WC
2. Use D4 to enter HALL
3. Use D6 to enter CUISINE

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the WC to the CUISINE, using only the necessary doors (D4 and D6) to reach the destination. The plan avoids any unnecessary rooms or doors, ensuring a direct path to the goal.
