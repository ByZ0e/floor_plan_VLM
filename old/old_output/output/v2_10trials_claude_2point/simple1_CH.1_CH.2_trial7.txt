Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms, doors, and their connections, then provide a navigation plan from CH.1 to CH.2.

Room and Door Connections:
- CH.1 connects to SEJOUR through D4
- CH.2 connects to SEJOUR through D3
- CH.3 connects to SEJOUR through D1 and D2
- SEJOUR is a large room connecting multiple spaces
- CUISINE connects to SEJOUR through D5 and D6

Navigation Plan:

To go from CH.1 to CH.2, we need to:
1. Exit CH.1 into SEJOUR
2. Cross SEJOUR
3. Enter CH.2

Here's the detailed action plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CH.1 to CH.2 using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours through other rooms.
