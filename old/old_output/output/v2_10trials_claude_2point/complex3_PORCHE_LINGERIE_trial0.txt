Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms, doors, and their connections, then provide a navigation plan from the PORCHE to the LINGERIE.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER
- D2: Connects PORCHE to CELLIER
- D3: Connects PORCHE to HALL
- D4: Connects HALL to WC
- D5: Connects HALL to LINGERIE
- D6: Connects HALL to BUREAU
- D7: Connects HALL to BAINS
- D8: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE PARENTS
- D9: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
- D10: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
- D11: Connects CELLIER to HALL

Navigation Plan:
To go from PORCHE to LINGERIE, we need to use doors D3 and D5.

Here's the step-by-step plan:
1. ApproachDoor(3)
2. OpenDoor(3)
3. GoThrough(3)
4. ApproachDoor(5)
5. OpenDoor(5)
6. GoThrough(5)

Now, I'll provide the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the PORCHE to the LINGERIE using only the necessary doors and actions.
