Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from SEJOUR to CH.1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects SEJOUR and PORCHE
2. D2 connects SEJOUR and CUISINE (upper)
3. D3 connects SEJOUR and CUISINE (lower)
4. D4 connects SEJOUR and DEGT
5. D5 connects CH.1 and DEGT
6. D6 connects CH.2 and DEGT
7. D7 connects BAINS and DEGT
8. D8 connects WC and DEGT

Step-by-step solution:
To navigate from SEJOUR to CH.1, we need to:
1. Approach and go through D4 to enter DEGT
2. Approach and go through D5 to enter CH.1

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D5"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D5"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D5"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from SEJOUR to CH.1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
