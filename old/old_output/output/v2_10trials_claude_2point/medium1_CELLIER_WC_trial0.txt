Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms, doors, and connections, then provide a navigation plan from the CELLIER to the WC.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

Rooms:
1. CELLIER
2. CUISINE (two sections)
3. SEJOUR (multiple sections)
4. CH.1
5. CH.2 (multiple sections)
6. DEGT (Dégagement - hallway)
7. BAINS
8. WC
9. Porche

Doors and their connections:
D2: Connects CELLIER to CUISINE
D3: Connects CUISINE to SEJOUR
D4: Connects SEJOUR to DEGT
D8: Connects DEGT to WC

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in CELLIER
2. Use D2 to enter CUISINE
3. Use D3 to enter SEJOUR
4. Use D4 to enter DEGT
5. Use D8 to reach WC

Now, I'll provide the detailed navigation plan in the requested format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides an efficient route from the CELLIER to the WC, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
