Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan from the BUREAU to the BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER
2. D2: Connects CELLIER and PORCHE
3. D3: Connects PORCHE and HALL
4. D4: Connects HALL and WC
5. D5: Connects LINGERIE and HALL
6. D6: Connects BUREAU and HALL
7. D7: Connects HALL and BAINS
8. D8: Connects BAINS and CHAMBRE PARENTS
9. D9: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
10. D10: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
11. D11: Connects CELLIER and HALL

Navigation Plan:
Starting from the BUREAU, we need to go through the HALL to reach the BAINS. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(6)
2. OpenDoor(6)
3. GoThrough(6)
4. ApproachDoor(7)
5. OpenDoor(7)
6. GoThrough(7)

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the BUREAU to the BAINS using only the necessary doors. The robot will exit the BUREAU through D6, enter the HALL, and then enter the BAINS through D7.
