Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the GARAGE to CHAMBRE 2.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
D2: Connects BAINS to HALL
D3: Connects WC to HALL
D4: Connects CHAMBRE 1 to HALL
D5: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to HALL
D6: Connects PORCHE to HALL
D7: Connects CUISINE to HALL
D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in GARAGE
2. Use D9 to enter CELLIER
3. Use D1 to enter HALL
4. Use D5 to enter CHAMBRE 2

Now, I'll provide the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D9"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D9"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D9"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D5"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D5"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D5"
    }
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan provides the most efficient route from the GARAGE to CHAMBRE 2, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
