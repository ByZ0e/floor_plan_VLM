Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from the GARAGE to CH.2.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

1. D1: Connects BAINS to HALL
2. D2: Connects CH.1 to HALL
3. D3: Connects CH.2 to HALL
4. D4: Connects GARAGE to CUISINE
5. D5: Connects CUISINE to HALL

Step-by-step solution:

1. Start in the GARAGE
2. Approach and go through D4 to enter CUISINE
3. Approach and go through D5 to enter HALL
4. Approach and go through D3 to enter CH.2

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from the GARAGE to CH.2, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
