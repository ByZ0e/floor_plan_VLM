Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms, doors, and their connections, then provide a navigation plan from CH.2 to SEJOUR.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

Rooms:
- CH.1
- CH.2
- CH.3
- SEJOUR (multiple instances)
- CUISINE

Doors and their connections:
D1: Connects CH.3 to SEJOUR
D2: Connects CH.2 to SEJOUR
D3: Connects CH.2 to SEJOUR
D4: Connects CH.1 to SEJOUR
D5: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
D6: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE

Now, let's create the navigation plan from CH.2 to SEJOUR:

Step-by-step solution:
1. We start in CH.2
2. We need to use either D2 or D3 to reach SEJOUR
3. D2 is closer, so we'll use that door

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 2
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 2
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 2
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from CH.2 to SEJOUR using the most direct path available.
