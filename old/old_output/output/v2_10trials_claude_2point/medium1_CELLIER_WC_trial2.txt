Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the CELLIER to the WC.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE through D2
2. CUISINE: Connected to CELLIER through D2, SEJOUR through D3
3. SEJOUR: Connected to CUISINE through D3, PORCHE through D1, DEGT through D4
4. PORCHE: Connected to SEJOUR through D1
5. DEGT: Connected to SEJOUR through D4, CH.2 through D6, BAINS through D7, WC through D8
6. CH.1: Connected to DEGT through D5
7. CH.2: Connected to DEGT through D6
8. BAINS: Connected to DEGT through D7
9. WC: Connected to DEGT through D8

Navigation Plan:
To go from CELLIER to WC, we need to follow these steps:

1. ApproachDoor(D2)
2. OpenDoor(D2)
3. GoThrough(D2)
4. ApproachDoor(D3)
5. OpenDoor(D3)
6. GoThrough(D3)
7. ApproachDoor(D4)
8. OpenDoor(D4)
9. GoThrough(D4)
10. ApproachDoor(D8)
11. OpenDoor(D8)
12. GoThrough(D8)

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently guide you from the CELLIER to the WC using only the necessary doors and rooms.
