Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the CELLIER to the HALL.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects GARAGES to CELLIER
2. D2: Connects GARAGES to HALL (near DOUCHE)
3. D3: Connects CELLIER to CUISINE
4. D4: Connects WC to HALL
5. D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
6. D6: Connects CUISINE to HALL
7. D7: Connects CUISINE to HALL (lower part)

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in CELLIER
2. Use D3 to enter CUISINE
3. Use D6 or D7 to enter HALL

Now, I'll provide the detailed action sequence in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 6
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 6
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 6
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the CELLIER to the HALL, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
