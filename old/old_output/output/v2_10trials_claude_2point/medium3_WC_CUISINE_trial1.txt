Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. Let's start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections based on the image:

Rooms and Door Connections:
1. WC connects to Hall through D4
2. Hall connects to Douche through D2
3. Hall connects to Chambre 1 through D5
4. Hall connects to Cuisine through D6
5. Hall connects to Cellier through D3
6. Cellier connects to Garages through D1
7. Cuisine connects to Hall through D7

Now, let's create a step-by-step navigation plan from the WC to the Cuisine:

1. Start in WC
2. ApproachDoor(D4)
3. OpenDoor(D4)
4. GoThrough(D4) to enter Hall
5. ApproachDoor(D6)
6. OpenDoor(D6)
7. GoThrough(D6) to enter Cuisine

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from the WC to the Cuisine, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
