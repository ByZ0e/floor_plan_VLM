Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from the CELLIER to the HALL.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
- D2: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to HALL
- D3: Connects HALL to BAINS
- D4: Connects HALL to WC
- D5: Connects PORCHE to HALL
- D6: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
- D7: Connects CUISINE to HALL
- D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
- D9: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in the CELLIER
2. ApproachDoor(D1)
3. OpenDoor(D1)
4. GoThrough(D1)

This sequence will take you directly from the CELLIER to the HALL.

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CELLIER",
  "end": "HALL",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"}
  ]
}
```

This is the most efficient path from the CELLIER to the HALL, using only the necessary door (D1) that directly connects these two spaces.
