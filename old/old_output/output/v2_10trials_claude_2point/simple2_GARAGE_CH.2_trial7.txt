Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the GARAGE to CH.2.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects BAINS to HALL
2. D2 connects CH.1 to HALL
3. D3 connects CH.2 to HALL
4. D4 connects GARAGE to CUISINE
5. D5 connects CUISINE to HALL

Based on these connections, here's the step-by-step navigation plan from GARAGE to CH.2:

1. Start in GARAGE
2. ApproachDoor(D4)
3. OpenDoor(D4)
4. GoThrough(D4) to enter CUISINE
5. ApproachDoor(D5)
6. OpenDoor(D5)
7. GoThrough(D5) to enter HALL
8. ApproachDoor(D3)
9. OpenDoor(D3)
10. GoThrough(D3) to enter CH.2

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    "ApproachDoor(D4)",
    "OpenDoor(D4)",
    "GoThrough(D4)",
    "ApproachDoor(D5)",
    "OpenDoor(D5)",
    "GoThrough(D5)",
    "ApproachDoor(D3)",
    "OpenDoor(D3)",
    "GoThrough(D3)"
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the GARAGE to CH.2, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
