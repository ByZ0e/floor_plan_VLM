Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a detailed navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects GARAGE and HALL
- D2: Connects CHAMBRE1 and HALL
- D3: Connects HALL and WC
- D4: Connects HALL and BAINS
- D5: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 3
- D6: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 2
- D7: Connects CELLIER and HALL
- D8: Connects HALL and Porche

Navigation Plan:
Starting from CELLIER to reach CHAMBRE 3, we need to use two doors: D7 and D5.

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CELLIER
2. Use D7 to enter HALL
3. From HALL, use D5 to enter CHAMBRE 3

Now, I'll provide the detailed action sequence in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 7
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 7
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 7
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 5
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 5
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 5
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from CELLIER to CHAMBRE 3, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
