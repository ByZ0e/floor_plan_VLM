Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll first list the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
- WC connects to Hall via D3
- Hall connects to Chambre 1 via D2
- Hall connects to Bains via D4
- Hall connects to Chambre 3 via D5
- Hall connects to Chambre 2 via D6
- Hall connects to Cellier via D7
- Hall connects to Porche via D8
- Garage connects to Cellier via D1

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in WC
2. ApproachDoor(D3)
3. OpenDoor(D3)
4. GoThrough(D3) to enter Hall
5. ApproachDoor(D6)
6. OpenDoor(D6)
7. GoThrough(D6) to enter Chambre 2

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "WC",
  "end": "CHAMBRE 2",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from the WC to Chambre 2, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
