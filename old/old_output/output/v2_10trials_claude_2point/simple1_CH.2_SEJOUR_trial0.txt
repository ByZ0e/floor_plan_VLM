Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from CH.2 to SEJOUR.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects CH.3 and SEJOUR
2. D2 connects CH.2 and CH.3
3. D3 connects CH.2 and SEJOUR
4. D4 connects CH.1 and SEJOUR
5. D5 connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
6. D6 connects SEJOUR and CUISINE

Now, let's create the navigation plan to go from CH.2 to SEJOUR:

Step-by-step solution:
1. We start in CH.2
2. The most direct path to SEJOUR is through D3
3. We need to approach D3, open it, and go through it to reach SEJOUR

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CH.2",
  "end": "SEJOUR",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from CH.2 to SEJOUR using only the necessary doors and actions.
