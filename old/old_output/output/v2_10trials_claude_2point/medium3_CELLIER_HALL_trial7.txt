Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the CELLIER to the HALL.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects GARAGES to CELLIER
2. D2: Connects GARAGES to DOUCHE
3. D3: Connects CELLIER to CUISINE
4. D4: Connects WC to HALL
5. D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
6. D6: Connects CUISINE to HALL
7. D7: Connects CUISINE to HALL

Navigation Plan:
To get from the CELLIER to the HALL, we need to use doors D3 and D6. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. Start in CELLIER
2. ApproachDoor(3)
3. OpenDoor(3)
4. GoThrough(3) // Now in CUISINE
5. ApproachDoor(6)
6. OpenDoor(6)
7. GoThrough(6) // Now in HALL

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CELLIER",
  "end": "HALL",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the CELLIER to the HALL, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
