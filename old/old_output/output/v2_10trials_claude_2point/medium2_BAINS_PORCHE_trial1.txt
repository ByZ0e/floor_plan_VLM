Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and their door connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from BAINS to PORCHE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. BAINS: Connected to HALL via D4
2. CHAMBRE 3: Connected to HALL via D5
3. CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL via D6
4. CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D2
5. WC: Connected to HALL via D3
6. GARAGE: Connected to HALL via D1
7. CELLIER: Connected to HALL via D7
8. PORCHE: Connected to HALL via D8

Step-by-step navigation plan:

1. Start in BAINS
2. ApproachDoor(D4)
3. OpenDoor(D4)
4. GoThrough(D4) to enter HALL
5. ApproachDoor(D8)
6. OpenDoor(D8)
7. GoThrough(D8) to reach PORCHE

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "BAINS",
  "end": "PORCHE",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from BAINS to PORCHE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
