Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from CHAMBRE 1 to the HALL.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects GARAGE to HALL
2. D2: Connects CHAMBRE 1 to HALL
3. D3: Connects HALL to WC
4. D4: Connects HALL to BAINS
5. D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 3
6. D6: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 2
7. D7: Connects HALL to CELLIER
8. D8: Connects HALL to Porche

Navigation Plan:
To go from CHAMBRE 1 to HALL, we only need to use one door: D2.

Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(2)
2. OpenDoor(2)
3. GoThrough(2)

Now, let's present this in the requested JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CHAMBRE 1",
  "end": "HALL",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2}
  ]
}
```

This plan is the most efficient route from CHAMBRE 1 to HALL, using only the necessary door (D2) to complete the navigation task.
