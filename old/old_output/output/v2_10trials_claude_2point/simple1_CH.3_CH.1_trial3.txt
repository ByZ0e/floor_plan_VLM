Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from CH.3 to CH.1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CH.3 connects to SEJOUR through D1
2. CH.2 connects to SEJOUR through D2
3. CH.2 connects to SEJOUR through D3
4. CH.1 connects to SEJOUR through D4
5. CUISINE connects to SEJOUR through D5 and D6

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in CH.3
2. ApproachDoor(D1)
3. OpenDoor(D1)
4. GoThrough(D1) to enter SEJOUR
5. ApproachDoor(D4)
6. OpenDoor(D4)
7. GoThrough(D4) to enter CH.1

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CH.3",
  "end": "CH.1",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from CH.3 to CH.1, using only the necessary doors (D1 and D4) and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
