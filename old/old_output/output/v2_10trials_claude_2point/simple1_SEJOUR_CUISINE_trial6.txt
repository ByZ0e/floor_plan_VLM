Thank you for providing the floor plan. Let me first list out the rooms and doors with their connections based on the image:

Rooms:
- SEJOUR (multiple instances)
- CH.1
- CH.2 (multiple instances)
- CH.3 (multiple instances)
- CUISINE

Doors and their connections:
- D1: Connects SEJOUR to CH.3
- D2: Connects CH.3 to CH.2
- D3: Connects CH.2 to SEJOUR
- D4: Connects SEJOUR to CH.1
- D5: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
- D6: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE

Now, let's create a navigation plan to go from SEJOUR to CUISINE:

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in SEJOUR
2. Approach door D5
3. Open door D5
4. Go through door D5 to enter CUISINE

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from SEJOUR to CUISINE using only the necessary doors. The robot will approach D5, open it, and go through to reach the CUISINE, completing the navigation task.
