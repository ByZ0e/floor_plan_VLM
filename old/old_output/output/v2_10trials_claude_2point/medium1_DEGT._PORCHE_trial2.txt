Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from DEGT to PORCHE.

Rooms and Doors Connections:
1. DEGT connects to SEJOUR via D4
2. DEGT connects to CH.2 via D6
3. DEGT connects to WC via D8
4. SEJOUR connects to CUISINE via D3
5. SEJOUR connects to PORCHE via D1
6. CUISINE connects to CELLIER via D2
7. CH.2 connects to CH.1 via D5
8. BAINS connects to WC via D7

Now, let's create the navigation plan to go from DEGT to PORCHE:

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in DEGT
2. Use D4 to enter SEJOUR
3. Use D1 to reach PORCHE

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D1"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from DEGT to PORCHE using only the necessary doors and rooms.
