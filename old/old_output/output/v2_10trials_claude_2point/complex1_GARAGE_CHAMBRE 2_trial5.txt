Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and their door connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan from the GARAGE to CHAMBRE 2.

Room and Door Connections:
1. GARAGE: Connected to CELLIER via D9
2. CELLIER: Connected to GARAGE via D9, HALL via D1
3. BAINS: Connected to HALL via D2
4. WC: Connected to HALL via D3
5. CHAMBRE 1: Connected to HALL via D4
6. CHAMBRE 2: Connected to HALL via D5
7. PORCHE: Connected to HALL via D6
8. CUISINE: Connected to HALL via D7
9. TERRASSE COUVERTE: Connected to CUISINE via D8
10. HALL: Central area connecting multiple rooms

Navigation Plan:
1. ApproachDoor(D9)
2. OpenDoor(D9)
3. GoThrough(D9)
4. ApproachDoor(D1)
5. OpenDoor(D1)
6. GoThrough(D1)
7. ApproachDoor(D5)
8. OpenDoor(D5)
9. GoThrough(D5)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan will efficiently guide you from the GARAGE to CHAMBRE 2 using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
