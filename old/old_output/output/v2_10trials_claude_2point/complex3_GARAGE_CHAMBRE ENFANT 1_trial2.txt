Certainly! I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan based on that information.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects Garage to Cellier
2. D2: Connects Cellier to Porche
3. D3: Connects Porche to Hall
4. D4: Connects Hall to WC
5. D5: Connects Hall to Lingerie
6. D6: Connects Hall to Bureau
7. D7: Connects Hall to Bains
8. D8: Connects Hall to Chambre Parents
9. D9: Connects Hall to Chambre Enfant 2
10. D10: Connects Hall to Chambre Enfant 1
11. D11: Connects Cellier to Hall

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in the Garage
2. Use D1 to enter Cellier
3. Use D11 to enter Hall
4. Use D10 to enter Chambre Enfant 1

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 11},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 10}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the Garage to Chambre Enfant 1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
