Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the GARAGE to CH.2.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects BAINS to HALL
2. D2 connects CH.1 to HALL
3. D3 connects CH.2 to HALL
4. D4 connects GARAGE to CUISINE
5. D5 connects CUISINE to HALL

Now, let's create the navigation plan:

Step 1: Start in the GARAGE
Step 2: Move to D4 (connecting GARAGE and CUISINE)
Step 3: Go through D4 to enter CUISINE
Step 4: Move to D5 (connecting CUISINE and HALL)
Step 5: Go through D5 to enter HALL
Step 6: Move to D3 (connecting HALL and CH.2)
Step 7: Go through D3 to enter CH.2

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the GARAGE to CH.2, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
