Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms, doors, and their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from CH.1 to CH.2.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

Rooms:
- CH.1
- CH.2
- CH.3
- SEJOUR (multiple instances)
- CUISINE

Doors and their connections:
D1: Connects CH.3 and SEJOUR
D2: Connects CH.3 and CH.2
D3: Connects CH.2 and SEJOUR
D4: Connects CH.1 and SEJOUR
D5: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
D6: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE

Step-by-step navigation plan from CH.1 to CH.2:

1. Start in CH.1
2. Use D4 to enter SEJOUR
3. Use D3 to enter CH.2

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CH.1",
  "end": "CH.2",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from CH.1 to CH.2 using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
