Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing all the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from the SEJOUR to the CUISINE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects SEJOUR and CH.3
2. D2: Connects CH.3 and CH.2
3. D3: Connects CH.2 and SEJOUR
4. D4: Connects SEJOUR and CH.1
5. D5: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
6. D6: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in SEJOUR
2. Approach D5
3. Open D5
4. Go through D5 to enter CUISINE

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "SEJOUR",
  "end": "CUISINE",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the SEJOUR to the CUISINE using only the necessary doors. The robot will approach D5, open it, and go through to reach the CUISINE directly from the SEJOUR.
