Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the CUISINE to CH.2.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

1. D1 connects SEJOUR and Porche
2. D2 connects CUISINE and CELLIER
3. D3 connects CUISINE and SEJOUR
4. D4 connects SEJOUR and DEGT
5. D5 connects DEGT and CH.1
6. D6 connects DEGT and CH.2
7. D7 connects DEGT and BAINS
8. D8 connects DEGT and WC

Step-by-step navigation plan:

1. Start in CUISINE
2. ApproachDoor(D3)
3. OpenDoor(D3)
4. GoThrough(D3) to enter SEJOUR
5. ApproachDoor(D4)
6. OpenDoor(D4)
7. GoThrough(D4) to enter DEGT
8. ApproachDoor(D6)
9. OpenDoor(D6)
10. GoThrough(D6) to enter CH.2

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CUISINE",
  "end": "CH.2",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the CUISINE to CH.2, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or actions.
