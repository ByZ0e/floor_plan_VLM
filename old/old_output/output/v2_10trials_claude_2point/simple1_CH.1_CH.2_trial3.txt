Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from CH.1 to CH.2.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects CH.3 and SEJOUR
2. D2 connects CH.2 and SEJOUR
3. D3 connects CH.2 and SEJOUR
4. D4 connects CH.1 and SEJOUR
5. D5 connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
6. D6 connects SEJOUR and CUISINE

Now, let's create the navigation plan to go from CH.1 to CH.2:

1. Start in CH.1
2. Use D4 to enter SEJOUR
3. From SEJOUR, use D3 to enter CH.2

Step-by-step solution:
1. ApproachDoor(4)
2. OpenDoor(4)
3. GoThrough(4)
4. ApproachDoor(3)
5. OpenDoor(3)
6. GoThrough(3)

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CH.1",
  "end": "CH.2",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from CH.1 to CH.2 using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or actions.
