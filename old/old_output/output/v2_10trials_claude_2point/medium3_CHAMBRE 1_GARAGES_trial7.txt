Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from CHAMBRE 1 to GARAGES.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects GARAGES to CELLIER
- D2: Connects GARAGES to DOUCHE
- D3: Connects CELLIER to CUISINE
- D4: Connects WC to HALL
- D5: Connects CHAMBRE 1 to HALL
- D6: Connects CUISINE to HALL
- D7: Connects CUISINE to HALL

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in CHAMBRE 1
2. Use D5 to enter the HALL
3. Move through the HALL to D6
4. Use D6 to enter the CUISINE
5. Move through the CUISINE to D3
6. Use D3 to enter the CELLIER
7. Move through the CELLIER to D1
8. Use D1 to enter the GARAGES

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CHAMBRE 1 to GARAGES using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
