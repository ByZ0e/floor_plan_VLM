Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the room and door connections, then provide a navigation plan from CHAMBRE 1 to GARAGES.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects GARAGES and CELLIER
D2: Connects DOUCHE and HALL
D3: Connects CELLIER and CUISINE
D4: Connects WC and HALL
D5: Connects CHAMBRE 1 and HALL
D6: Connects CUISINE and HALL
D7: Connects CUISINE and HALL

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in CHAMBRE 1
2. Use D5 to enter HALL
3. Use D6 to enter CUISINE
4. Use D3 to enter CELLIER
5. Use D1 to enter GARAGES

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CHAMBRE 1",
  "end": "GARAGES",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from CHAMBRE 1 to GARAGES, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
