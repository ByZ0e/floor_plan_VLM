Certainly! I'll analyze the floor plan, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects SEJOUR to CH.3
2. D2: Connects CH.2 to CH.3
3. D3: Connects CH.2 to SEJOUR
4. D4: Connects CH.1 to SEJOUR
5. D5: Connects CUISINE to SEJOUR
6. D6: Connects CUISINE to SEJOUR

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CUISINE
2. Use D5 or D6 to enter SEJOUR
3. From SEJOUR, use D1 to enter CH.3

Based on this analysis, here's the efficient navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct route from the CUISINE to CH.3, using only the necessary doors (D5 and D1) and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors. The plan takes into account that doors close after each GoThrough action, so each door is approached, opened, and gone through in sequence.
