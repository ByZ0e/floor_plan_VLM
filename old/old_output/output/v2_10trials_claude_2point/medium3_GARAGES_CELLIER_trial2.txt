Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the GARAGES to the CELLIER.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

1. D1 connects GARAGES to CELLIER
2. D2 connects GARAGES to DOUCHE
3. D3 connects CELLIER to CUISINE
4. D4 connects WC to HALL
5. D5 connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
6. D6 connects HALL to CUISINE
7. D7 connects HALL to CUISINE (second instance)

Step-by-step solution:
To navigate from GARAGES to CELLIER, we only need to use one door: D1.

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently guide you from the GARAGES to the CELLIER using the most direct route available according to the floor plan.
