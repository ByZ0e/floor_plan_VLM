Thank you for providing the floor plan image. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from CHAMBRE 2 to WC.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
- D2: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to HALL
- D3: Connects HALL to BAINS
- D4: Connects HALL to WC
- D5: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to HALL (near PORCHE)
- D6: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
- D7: Connects CUISINE to HALL
- D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
- D9: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in CHAMBRE 2
2. Approach and open door D2
3. Go through D2 to enter the HALL
4. In the HALL, approach and open door D4
5. Go through D4 to reach the WC

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from CHAMBRE 2 to WC, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
