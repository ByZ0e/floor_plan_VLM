Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan for you to move from the CELLIER to CHAMBRE 3.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects GARAGE and HALL
2. D2: Connects CHAMBRE 1 and HALL
3. D3: Connects HALL and WC
4. D4: Connects HALL and BAINS
5. D5: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 3
6. D6: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 2
7. D7: Connects CELLIER and HALL
8. D8: Connects HALL and Porche

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in CELLIER
2. Use D7 to enter HALL
3. Use D5 to enter CHAMBRE 3

Now, I'll provide the detailed action sequence in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 7
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 7
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 7
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 5
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 5
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 5
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the CELLIER to CHAMBRE 3, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
