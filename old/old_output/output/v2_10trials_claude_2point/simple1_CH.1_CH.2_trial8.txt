Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from CH.1 to CH.2.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

1. CH.1 connects to SEJOUR through D4
2. CH.2 connects to SEJOUR through D3
3. CH.3 connects to SEJOUR through D1 and D2
4. CUISINE connects to SEJOUR through D5 and D6

Now, let's create the navigation plan from CH.1 to CH.2:

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CH.1
2. Use D4 to enter SEJOUR
3. Cross SEJOUR
4. Use D3 to enter CH.2

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from CH.1 to CH.2, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
