Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll first list out the room and door connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan, and finally present the plan in JSON format.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects CELLIER and HALL
D2: Connects BAINS and HALL
D3: Connects WC and HALL
D4: Connects CHAMBRE 1 and HALL
D5: Connects CHAMBRE 2 and HALL
D6: Connects HALL and PORCHE
D7: Connects HALL and CUISINE
D8: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Connects CELLIER and GARAGE

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
1. Start in CHAMBRE 1
2. ApproachDoor(D4)
3. OpenDoor(D4)
4. GoThrough(D4) to enter HALL
5. ApproachDoor(D7)
6. OpenDoor(D7)
7. GoThrough(D7) to enter CUISINE
8. ApproachDoor(D8)
9. OpenDoor(D8)
10. GoThrough(D8) to reach TERRASSE COUVERTE

JSON Format Navigation Plan:
```json
{
  "start": "CHAMBRE 1",
  "end": "TERRASSE COUVERTE",
  "actions": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan provides the most efficient path from CHAMBRE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
