Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan from CH.1 to the GARAGE.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

1. CH.1 connects to the hall via D2
2. CH.2 connects to the hall via D3
3. BAINS (bathroom) connects to the hall via D1
4. GARAGE connects to the hall via D4
5. CUISINE (kitchen) connects to the hall via D5

Step-by-step navigation plan:

1. Start in CH.1
2. Approach and open D2 to enter the hall
3. Move through the hall
4. Approach and open D4 to enter the GARAGE

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from CH.1 to the GARAGE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
