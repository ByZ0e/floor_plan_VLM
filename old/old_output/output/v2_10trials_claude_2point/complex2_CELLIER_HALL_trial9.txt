Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the connections and provide a navigation plan as requested.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
D2: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to HALL
D3: Connects BAINS to HALL
D4: Connects WC to HALL
D5: Connects PORCHE to HALL
D6: Connects CHAMBRE 1 to HALL
D7: Connects CUISINE to HALL
D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CELLIER
2. Use D1 to go from CELLIER to HALL

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D1"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the CELLIER to the HALL using only the necessary door (D1). The robot will approach D1, open it, and go through to reach the HALL, which is the final destination.
