Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from the GARAGE to the BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D9: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER
2. D1: Connects CELLIER and HALL
3. D2: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 2
4. D5: Connects HALL and PORCHE
5. D3: Connects HALL and BAINS
6. D4: Connects HALL and WC
7. D6: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 1
8. D7: Connects HALL and CUISINE
9. D8: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in the GARAGE
2. Approach and go through D9 to enter CELLIER
3. Approach and go through D1 to enter HALL
4. Approach and go through D3 to reach BAINS

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the GARAGE to the BAINS, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
