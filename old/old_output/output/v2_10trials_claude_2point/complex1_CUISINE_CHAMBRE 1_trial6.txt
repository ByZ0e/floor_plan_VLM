Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from the CUISINE to CHAMBRE 1.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
- D2: Connects BAINS to HALL
- D3: Connects WC to HALL
- D4: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
- D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 2
- D6: Connects HALL to PORCHE
- D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE
- D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
- D9: Connects CELLIER to GARAGE

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in CUISINE
2. ApproachDoor(D7)
3. OpenDoor(D7)
4. GoThrough(D7)
5. ApproachDoor(D4)
6. OpenDoor(D4)
7. GoThrough(D4)

Now, I'll provide the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CUISINE",
  "end": "CHAMBRE 1",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan will efficiently guide you from the CUISINE to CHAMBRE 1 using only the necessary doors and actions.
