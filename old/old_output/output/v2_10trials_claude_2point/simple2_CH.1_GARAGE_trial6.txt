Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from CH.1 to the GARAGE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CH.1 connects to the hall via D2
2. CH.2 connects to the hall via D3
3. BAINS connects to the hall via D1
4. GARAGE connects to the hall via D4
5. CUISINE connects to the hall via D5

Navigation Plan:
To get from CH.1 to the GARAGE, we need to go through the hall. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(2)
2. OpenDoor(2)
3. GoThrough(2)
4. ApproachDoor(4)
5. OpenDoor(4)
6. GoThrough(4)

Now, I'll provide this plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CH.1",
  "end": "GARAGE",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CH.1 to the GARAGE using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
