Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and door connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER
2. D2: Connects CELLIER and PORCHE
3. D3: Connects PORCHE and HALL
4. D4: Connects HALL and WC
5. D5: Connects HALL and LINGERIE
6. D6: Connects HALL and BUREAU
7. D7: Connects HALL and BAINS
8. D8: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE PARENTS
9. D9: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
10. D10: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
11. D11: Connects HALL and CELLIER

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in the HALL
2. Approach door D9
3. Open door D9
4. Go through door D9 to enter CHAMBRE ENFANT 2

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 9},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 9}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from the HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2, using only the necessary doors and actions.
