Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the CELLIER to CHAMBRE 3.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects GARAGE and HALL
2. D2: Connects CHAMBRE 1 and HALL
3. D3: Connects HALL and WC
4. D4: Connects HALL and BAINS
5. D5: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 3
6. D6: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 2
7. D7: Connects CELLIER and HALL
8. D8: Connects HALL and Porche

Navigation Plan:
To navigate from CELLIER to CHAMBRE 3, we need to use the following sequence of actions:

1. ApproachDoor(7)
2. OpenDoor(7)
3. GoThrough(7)
4. ApproachDoor(5)
5. OpenDoor(5)
6. GoThrough(5)

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CELLIER",
  "end": "CHAMBRE 3",
  "actions": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from the CELLIER to CHAMBRE 3, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
