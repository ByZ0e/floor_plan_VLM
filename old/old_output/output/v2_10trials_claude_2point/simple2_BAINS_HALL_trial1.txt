Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from BAINS to HALL.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects BAINS to HALL
- D2: Connects CH.1 to HALL
- D3: Connects CH.2 to HALL
- D4: Connects GARAGE to CUISINE
- D5: Connects CUISINE to HALL

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
1. Start in BAINS
2. Approach door D1
3. Open door D1
4. Go through door D1 to enter HALL

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from BAINS to HALL using only the necessary door (D1) and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
