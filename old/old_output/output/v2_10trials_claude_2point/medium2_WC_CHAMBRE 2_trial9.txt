Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the WC to CHAMBRE 2.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects GARAGE and HALL
2. D2: Connects CHAMBRE 1 and HALL
3. D3: Connects WC and HALL
4. D4: Connects BAINS and HALL
5. D5: Connects CHAMBRE 3 and HALL
6. D6: Connects CHAMBRE 2 and HALL
7. D7: Connects CELLIER and HALL
8. D8: Connects HALL and Porche

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in WC
2. Use D3 to enter HALL
3. Move through HALL
4. Use D6 to enter CHAMBRE 2

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 3
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 6
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 6
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 6
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from the WC to CHAMBRE 2, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
