Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the BAINS to the PORCHE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects GARAGE to HALL
2. D2: Connects CHAMBRE1 to HALL
3. D3: Connects WC to HALL
4. D4: Connects BAINS to HALL
5. D5: Connects CHAMBRE3 to HALL
6. D6: Connects CHAMBRE2 to HALL
7. D7: Connects CELLIER to HALL
8. D8: Connects HALL to PORCHE

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in BAINS
2. ApproachDoor(D4)
3. OpenDoor(D4)
4. GoThrough(D4) to enter HALL
5. ApproachDoor(D8)
6. OpenDoor(D8)
7. GoThrough(D8) to reach PORCHE

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "BAINS",
  "end": "PORCHE",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the BAINS to the PORCHE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
