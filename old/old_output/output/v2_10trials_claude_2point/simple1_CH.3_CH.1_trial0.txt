Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms and doors, create a list of connections, and then provide a navigation plan from CH.3 to CH.1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects CH.3 and SEJOUR (left side)
2. D2 connects CH.2 and SEJOUR (left side)
3. D3 connects CH.2 and SEJOUR (center)
4. D4 connects CH.1 and SEJOUR (right side)
5. D5 connects CUISINE and SEJOUR (bottom right)
6. D6 connects CUISINE and SEJOUR (bottom center)

Navigation Plan:
To go from CH.3 to CH.1, we need to use doors D1 and D4. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(1)
2. OpenDoor(1)
3. GoThrough(1)
4. ApproachDoor(4)
5. OpenDoor(4)
6. GoThrough(4)

Now, I'll provide the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "doorNumber": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "doorNumber": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "doorNumber": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "doorNumber": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "doorNumber": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "doorNumber": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CH.3 to CH.1 using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
