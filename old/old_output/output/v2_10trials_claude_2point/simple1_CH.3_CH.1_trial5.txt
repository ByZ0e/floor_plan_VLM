Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. Let me start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections based on the image:

Room and Door Connections:
1. CH.3 connects to SEJOUR through D1
2. CH.2 connects to SEJOUR through D2
3. CH.2 connects to SEJOUR through D3
4. CH.1 connects to SEJOUR through D4
5. CUISINE connects to SEJOUR through D5 and D6

Now, let's create a step-by-step navigation plan to go from CH.3 to CH.1:

1. Start in CH.3
2. Approach and open D1 to enter SEJOUR
3. Move through SEJOUR
4. Approach and open D4 to enter CH.1

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from CH.3 to CH.1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
