Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from the GARAGE to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER
2. D2: Connects CELLIER to PORCHE
3. D3: Connects PORCHE to HALL
4. D4: Connects HALL to WC
5. D5: Connects HALL to LINGERIE
6. D6: Connects HALL to BUREAU
7. D7: Connects HALL to BAINS
8. D8: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE PARENTS
9. D9: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
10. D10: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
11. D11: Connects CELLIER to HALL

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in the GARAGE
2. ApproachDoor(1)
3. OpenDoor(1)
4. GoThrough(1) - Now in CELLIER
5. ApproachDoor(11)
6. OpenDoor(11)
7. GoThrough(11) - Now in HALL
8. ApproachDoor(10)
9. OpenDoor(10)
10. GoThrough(10) - Now in CHAMBRE ENFANT 1

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 11},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 11},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 10},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 10}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the GARAGE to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
