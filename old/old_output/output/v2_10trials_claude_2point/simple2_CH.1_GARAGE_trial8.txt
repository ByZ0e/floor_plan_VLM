Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a detailed navigation plan from CH.1 to the GARAGE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects CH.1 and HALL (near BAINS)
2. D2 connects CH.1 and HALL (between CH.1 and CH.2)
3. D3 connects CH.2 and HALL
4. D4 connects GARAGE and CUISINE
5. D5 connects CUISINE and HALL

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
1. Start in CH.1
2. Approach and go through D2 to enter the HALL
3. Move through the HALL to D4
4. Go through D4 to enter the GARAGE

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from CH.1 to the GARAGE using only the necessary doors. The robot will exit CH.1 through D2, navigate through the HALL, and then enter the GARAGE through D4.
