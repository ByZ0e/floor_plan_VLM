Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the CUISINE to CH.3.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects SEJOUR to CH.3
2. D2: Connects CH.2 to CH.3
3. D3: Connects CH.2 to SEJOUR
4. D4: Connects CH.1 to SEJOUR
5. D5: Connects CUISINE to SEJOUR
6. D6: Connects CUISINE to SEJOUR

Now, let's create a step-by-step navigation plan:

1. Start in CUISINE
2. Use D5 to enter SEJOUR
3. Cross SEJOUR
4. Use D1 to enter CH.3

Here's the detailed action plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 5
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 5
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 5
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the CUISINE to CH.3, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
