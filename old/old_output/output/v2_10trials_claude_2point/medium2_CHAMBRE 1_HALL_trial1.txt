Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the room and door connections, then provide a navigation plan from CHAMBRE 1 to HALL.

Explicit Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER
- D2: Connects CHAMBRE 1 to HALL
- D3: Connects HALL to WC
- D4: Connects HALL to BAINS
- D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 3
- D6: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 2
- D7: Connects CELLIER to HALL
- D8: Connects HALL to Porche

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in CHAMBRE 1
2. Use D2 to enter HALL

Since we're starting in CHAMBRE 1 and our goal is to reach HALL, we only need to use one door (D2) to complete this task.

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from CHAMBRE 1 to HALL using only the necessary door (D2) without any unnecessary steps or rooms.
