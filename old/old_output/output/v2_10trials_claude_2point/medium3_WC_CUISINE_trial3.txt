Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the WC to the CUISINE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects GARAGES to CELLIER
2. D2: Connects GARAGES to DOUCHE
3. D3: Connects CELLIER to CUISINE
4. D4: Connects WC to HALL
5. D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
6. D6: Connects HALL to CUISINE
7. D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE (second entrance)

Navigation Plan:
To go from WC to CUISINE, we need to use doors D4 and D6. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(4)
2. OpenDoor(4)
3. GoThrough(4)
4. ApproachDoor(6)
5. OpenDoor(6)
6. GoThrough(6)

This plan takes you from the WC to the HALL, and then from the HALL to the CUISINE.

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6}
  ]
}
```

This path efficiently takes you from the WC to the CUISINE using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
