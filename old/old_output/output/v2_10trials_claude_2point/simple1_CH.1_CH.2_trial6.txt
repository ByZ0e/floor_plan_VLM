Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from CH.1 to CH.2.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D4 connects CH.1 and SEJOUR
2. D3 connects SEJOUR and CH.2
3. D2 connects CH.2 and CH.3
4. D1 connects CH.3 and SEJOUR
5. D5 connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
6. D6 connects SEJOUR and CUISINE

Now, let's create the navigation plan from CH.1 to CH.2:

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CH.1
2. Use D4 to enter SEJOUR
3. Use D3 to enter CH.2

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from CH.1 to CH.2, using only the necessary doors (D4 and D3) and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
