Certainly! I'll analyze the floor plan, list out the room and door connections, and then provide a detailed navigation plan for you to move from the GARAGES to the CELLIER.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects GARAGES to CELLIER
D2: Connects GARAGES to HALL (near DOUCHE)
D3: Connects CELLIER to CUISINE
D4: Connects HALL to WC
D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
D6: Connects HALL to CUISINE
D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE (different part)

Step-by-step solution:

To navigate from GARAGES to CELLIER, we only need to use one door: D1.

Here's the detailed navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "doorNumber": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "doorNumber": 1
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "doorNumber": 1
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently take you from the GARAGES directly to the CELLIER using the most direct route available. No other doors or rooms need to be traversed for this particular navigation task.
