Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan as requested.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects Garages to Cellier
D2: Connects Garages to Douche
D3: Connects Cellier to Cuisine
D4: Connects WC to Hall
D5: Connects Hall to Chambre 1
D6: Connects Cuisine to Hall
D7: Connects Cuisine to Hall

Now, let's create the navigation plan from Douche to Chambre 1:

1. Start in Douche
2. ApproachDoor(D2)
3. OpenDoor(D2)
4. GoThrough(D2) - Now in Garages
5. ApproachDoor(D1)
6. OpenDoor(D1)
7. GoThrough(D1) - Now in Cellier
8. ApproachDoor(D3)
9. OpenDoor(D3)
10. GoThrough(D3) - Now in Cuisine
11. ApproachDoor(D6)
12. OpenDoor(D6)
13. GoThrough(D6) - Now in Hall
14. ApproachDoor(D5)
15. OpenDoor(D5)
16. GoThrough(D5) - Now in Chambre 1

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D2"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides an efficient route from Douche to Chambre 1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
