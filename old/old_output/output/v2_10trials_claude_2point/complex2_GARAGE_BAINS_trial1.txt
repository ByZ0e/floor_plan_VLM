Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the GARAGE to the BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D9: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER
2. D1: Connects CELLIER and HALL
3. D2: Connects CHAMBRE 2 and HALL
4. D5: Connects PORCHE and HALL
5. D7: Connects CUISINE and HALL
6. D8: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
7. D6: Connects CHAMBRE 1 and HALL
8. D4: Connects WC and HALL
9. D3: Connects BAINS and HALL

Navigation Plan:
1. ApproachDoor(D9)
2. OpenDoor(D9)
3. GoThrough(D9)
4. ApproachDoor(D1)
5. OpenDoor(D1)
6. GoThrough(D1)
7. ApproachDoor(D3)
8. OpenDoor(D3)
9. GoThrough(D3)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"}
  ]
}
```

This path takes you from the GARAGE to the BAINS efficiently, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
