Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the CUISINE to CHAMBRE 1.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects CELLIER and HALL
D2: Connects BAINS and HALL
D3: Connects WC and HALL
D4: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 1
D5: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 2
D6: Connects HALL and PORCHE
D7: Connects HALL and CUISINE
D8: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Connects CELLIER and GARAGE

Navigation Plan:
To go from CUISINE to CHAMBRE 1, we need to use two doors: D7 and D4.

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CUISINE
2. Use D7 to enter HALL
3. Use D4 to enter CHAMBRE 1

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 7
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 7
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 7
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 4
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from CUISINE to CHAMBRE 1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
