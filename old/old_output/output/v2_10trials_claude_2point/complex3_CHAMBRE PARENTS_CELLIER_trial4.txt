Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from CHAMBRE PARENTS to CELLIER.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER
D2: Connects PORCHE and CELLIER
D3: Connects PORCHE and HALL
D4: Connects HALL and WC
D5: Connects HALL and LINGERIE
D6: Connects HALL and BUREAU
D7: Connects HALL and BAINS
D8: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE PARENTS
D9: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
D10: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
D11: Connects HALL and CELLIER

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in CHAMBRE PARENTS
2. ApproachDoor(D8)
3. OpenDoor(D8)
4. GoThrough(D8) to enter HALL
5. ApproachDoor(D11)
6. OpenDoor(D11)
7. GoThrough(D11) to reach CELLIER

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CHAMBRE PARENTS",
  "end": "CELLIER",
  "actions": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D11"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D11"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from CHAMBRE PARENTS to CELLIER, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
