Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the connections and provide a navigation plan as requested.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects Garage to Hall
D2: Connects Chambre 1 to Hall
D3: Connects Hall to WC
D4: Connects Bains to Hall
D5: Connects Hall to Chambre 3
D6: Connects Hall to Chambre 2
D7: Connects Cellier to Hall
D8: Connects Hall to Porche

Step-by-step solution:

1. Start in Bains
2. Use D4 to enter the Hall
3. Move through the Hall
4. Use D8 to reach the Porche

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the Bains to the Porche, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
