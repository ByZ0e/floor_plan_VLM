Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the connections and provide a navigation plan as requested.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects CH.3 to SEJOUR
D2: Connects CH.2 to CH.3
D3: Connects CH.2 to SEJOUR
D4: Connects CH.1 to SEJOUR
D5: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE
D6: Connects SEJOUR to CUISINE

Now, let's create a navigation plan from CH.2 to SEJOUR:

Step-by-step solution:
1. We start in CH.2
2. We need to use D3 to reach SEJOUR directly

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from CH.2 to SEJOUR using only the necessary doors and actions.
