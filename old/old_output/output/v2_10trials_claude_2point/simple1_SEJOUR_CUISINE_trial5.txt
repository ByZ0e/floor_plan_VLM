Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. Let me first list out the rooms and doors with their connections based on the image:

Room and Door Connections:
1. SEJOUR connects to CH.2 via D3
2. SEJOUR connects to CH.1 via D4
3. SEJOUR connects to CUISINE via D5 and D6
4. CH.3 connects to CH.2 via D2
5. CH.3 connects to SEJOUR via D1

Now, let's create a step-by-step navigation plan to get from SEJOUR to CUISINE:

Step 1: We start in SEJOUR.
Step 2: We need to approach D5, which leads to CUISINE.
Step 3: Open D5.
Step 4: Go through D5 to enter the small connecting area.
Step 5: Approach D6, which leads to CUISINE.
Step 6: Open D6.
Step 7: Go through D6 to enter CUISINE.

Based on this analysis, here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from SEJOUR to CUISINE using only the necessary doors (D5 and D6) that are part of the path being used. The plan takes into account that doors close after each GoThrough action, so we need to open each door before going through it.
