Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a detailed navigation plan to get from the GARAGE to the BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D9 connects GARAGE to CELLIER
2. D1 connects CELLIER to HALL
3. D2 connects HALL to CHAMBRE 2
4. D5 connects HALL to PORCHE
5. D3 connects HALL to BAINS
6. D4 connects HALL to WC
7. D6 connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
8. D7 connects HALL to CUISINE
9. D8 connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. ApproachDoor(D9)
2. OpenDoor(D9)
3. GoThrough(D9)
4. ApproachDoor(D1)
5. OpenDoor(D1)
6. GoThrough(D1)
7. ApproachDoor(D3)
8. OpenDoor(D3)
9. GoThrough(D3)

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D9"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"}
  ]
}
```

This plan efficiently navigates from the GARAGE to the BAINS using the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary detours.
