Certainly! I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan based on those connections.

Room and Door Connections:
1. WC:
   - D4 connects to Hall
2. Hall:
   - D4 connects to WC
   - D5 connects to Chambre 1
   - D6 connects to Cuisine
3. Chambre 1:
   - D5 connects to Hall
4. Cuisine:
   - D6 connects to Hall
   - D3 connects to Cellier
5. Cellier:
   - D3 connects to Cuisine

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
1. Start in WC
2. Use D4 to enter Hall
3. Use D6 to enter Cuisine

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from the WC to the Cuisine, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
