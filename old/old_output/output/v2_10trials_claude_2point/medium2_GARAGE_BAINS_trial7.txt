Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the GARAGE to the BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
1. GARAGE - D1 - HALL
2. CHAMBRE 1 - D2 - HALL
3. CHAMBRE 1 - D3 - HALL (near WC)
4. BAINS - D4 - HALL
5. CHAMBRE 3 - D5 - HALL
6. CHAMBRE 2 - D6 - HALL
7. CELLIER - D7 - HALL
8. PORCHE - D8 - HALL

Navigation Plan:
To get from the GARAGE to the BAINS, we need to go through the following sequence:

1. ApproachDoor(1)
2. OpenDoor(1)
3. GoThrough(1)
4. ApproachDoor(4)
5. OpenDoor(4)
6. GoThrough(4)

Here's the navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "GARAGE",
  "end": "BAINS",
  "steps": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from the GARAGE to the BAINS, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
