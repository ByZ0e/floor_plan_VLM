Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from the CUISINE to CH.3.

Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects SEJOUR to CH.3
D2: Connects CH.2 to CH.3
D3: Connects CH.2 to SEJOUR
D4: Connects CH.1 to SEJOUR
D5: Connects CUISINE to SEJOUR
D6: Connects CUISINE to SEJOUR

Now, let's create the navigation plan:

1. Start in CUISINE
2. Use D5 to enter SEJOUR
3. Use D1 to enter CH.3

Step-by-step solution:
1. ApproachDoor(5)
2. OpenDoor(5)
3. GoThrough(5)
4. ApproachDoor(1)
5. OpenDoor(1)
6. GoThrough(1)

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CUISINE",
  "end": "CH.3",
  "actions": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the CUISINE to CH.3, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
