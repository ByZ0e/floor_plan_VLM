Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms and doors, create a list of connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from SEJOUR to CH.1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects SEJOUR and Porche
2. D2 connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
3. D3 connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
4. D4 connects SEJOUR and DEGT
5. D5 connects CH.1 and DEGT
6. D6 connects CH.2 and DEGT
7. D7 connects BAINS and DEGT
8. D8 connects WC and DEGT

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in SEJOUR
2. Approach and go through D4 to enter DEGT
3. From DEGT, approach and go through D5 to enter CH.1

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from SEJOUR to CH.1 using only the necessary doors. The robot will start in SEJOUR, go through D4 to enter DEGT, and then through D5 to reach CH.1.
