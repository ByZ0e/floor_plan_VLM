Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the room and door connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the SEJOUR to the CUISINE.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects SEJOUR and CH.3
D2: Connects CH.3 and CH.2
D3: Connects CH.2 and SEJOUR
D4: Connects SEJOUR and CH.1
D5: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
D6: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE

Navigation Plan:

Starting from the SEJOUR, we need to reach the CUISINE. There are two possible doors that lead directly to the CUISINE: D5 and D6. For efficiency, we'll use D5 as it appears to be the most direct route.

Here's the step-by-step navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 5
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 5
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 5
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the SEJOUR to the CUISINE using the most direct route available.
