Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the PORCHE to the LINGERIE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects GARAGE and CELLIER
2. D2: Connects PORCHE and CELLIER
3. D3: Connects PORCHE and HALL
4. D4: Connects HALL and WC
5. D5: Connects HALL and LINGERIE
6. D6: Connects HALL and BUREAU
7. D7: Connects HALL and BAINS
8. D8: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE PARENTS
9. D9: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 2
10. D10: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE ENFANT 1
11. D11: Connects CELLIER and HALL

Step-by-step navigation plan from PORCHE to LINGERIE:
1. Start in PORCHE
2. ApproachDoor(D3)
3. OpenDoor(D3)
4. GoThrough(D3) - Now in HALL
5. ApproachDoor(D5)
6. OpenDoor(D5)
7. GoThrough(D5) - Now in LINGERIE

JSON format of the final path:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan provides the most direct and efficient route from the PORCHE to the LINGERIE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
