Certainly! I'll analyze the floor plan, provide a list of room and door connections, and then create a detailed navigation plan for you to move from the GARAGES to the CELLIER.

Explicit Room and Door Connections:
D1: Connects GARAGES to CELLIER
D2: Connects GARAGES to DOUCHE
D3: Connects CELLIER to CUISINE
D4: Connects WC to HALL
D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
D6: Connects HALL to CUISINE
D7: Connects HALL to CUISINE (second instance)

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in GARAGES
2. Approach door D1
3. Open door D1
4. Go through door D1 to enter CELLIER

Final Navigation Plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "GARAGES",
  "end": "CELLIER",
  "actions": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient path from the GARAGES to the CELLIER. It only uses the necessary door (D1) and doesn't involve any unnecessary rooms or doors. The plan takes into account that you're a robot that cannot pass through walls and must use doors for navigation.
