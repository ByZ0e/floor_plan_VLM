Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from the SEJOUR to the CUISINE.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects SEJOUR and CH.3
- D2: Connects CH.3 and CH.2
- D3: Connects CH.2 and SEJOUR
- D4: Connects SEJOUR and CH.1
- D5: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
- D6: Connects SEJOUR and CUISINE

For this navigation task, we only need to use one door to get from the SEJOUR to the CUISINE. The most direct path is through D5.

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in SEJOUR
2. Approach D5
3. Open D5
4. Go through D5 to enter CUISINE

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from the SEJOUR to the CUISINE using only the necessary door (D5) to complete the navigation task.
