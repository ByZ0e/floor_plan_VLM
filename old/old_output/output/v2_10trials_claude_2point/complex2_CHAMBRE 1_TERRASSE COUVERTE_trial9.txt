Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan to get from CHAMBRE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
- D2: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to HALL
- D3: Connects BAINS to HALL
- D4: Connects WC to HALL
- D5: Connects PORCHE to HALL
- D6: Connects CHAMBRE 1 to HALL
- D7: Connects CUISINE to HALL
- D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
- D9: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER

Step-by-step navigation plan:

1. Start in CHAMBRE 1
2. Use D6 to enter the HALL
3. Move through the HALL
4. Use D7 to enter the CUISINE
5. Use D8 to reach the TERRASSE COUVERTE

Now, I'll provide the detailed action sequence in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 6},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 6},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from CHAMBRE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
