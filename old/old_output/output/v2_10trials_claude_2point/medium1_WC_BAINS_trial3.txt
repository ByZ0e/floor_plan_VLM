Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms, doors, and their connections, then provide a navigation plan from the WC to the BAINS.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

Rooms:
- Porche
- Cellier
- Cuisine (2 sections)
- Sejour (3 sections)
- WC
- Bains
- Degt (Dégagement, likely a hallway)
- CH.1 (2 sections)
- CH.2 (3 sections)

Doors and their connections:
D1: Connects Porche and Sejour
D2: Connects Cellier and Cuisine
D3: Connects Sejour and Cuisine
D4: Connects Sejour and Degt
D5: Connects CH.1 and Degt
D6: Connects CH.2 and Degt
D7: Connects Degt and Bains
D8: Connects WC and Degt

Now, let's create the navigation plan from WC to BAINS:

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in WC
2. Use D8 to enter Degt
3. From Degt, use D7 to enter Bains

Final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "WC",
  "end": "BAINS",
  "actions": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from the WC to the BAINS, using only the necessary doors (D8 and D7) to reach the destination.
