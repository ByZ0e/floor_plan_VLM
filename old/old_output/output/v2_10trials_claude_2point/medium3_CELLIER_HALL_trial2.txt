Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the CELLIER to the HALL.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects GARAGES to CELLIER
- D2: Connects GARAGES to DOUCHE
- D3: Connects CELLIER to CUISINE
- D4: Connects WC to HALL
- D5: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE 1
- D6: Connects HALL to CUISINE
- D7: Connects CUISINE to HALL

Now, let's create the navigation plan to go from CELLIER to HALL:

1. Start in CELLIER
2. ApproachDoor(D3)
3. OpenDoor(D3)
4. GoThrough(D3) [Now in CUISINE]
5. ApproachDoor(D6)
6. OpenDoor(D6)
7. GoThrough(D6) [Now in HALL]

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CELLIER",
  "end": "HALL",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the CELLIER to the HALL, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
