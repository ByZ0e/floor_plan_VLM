Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from CHAMBRE PARENTS to CELLIER.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D8: Connects CHAMBRE PARENTS to HALL
2. D7: Connects HALL to BAINS
3. D6: Connects HALL to BUREAU
4. D5: Connects HALL to LINGERIE
5. D4: Connects HALL to WC

11. D10: Connects HALL to CHAMBRE ENFANT 1

Navigation Plan:
1. ApproachDoor(8)
2. OpenDoor(8)
3. GoThrough(8)
4. ApproachDoor(3)
5. OpenDoor(3)
6. GoThrough(3)
7. ApproachDoor(2)
8. OpenDoor(2)
9. GoThrough(2)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 3},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 3},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2}
  ]
}
```

This path takes you from CHAMBRE PARENTS to CELLIER using the most direct route based on the floor plan provided.
