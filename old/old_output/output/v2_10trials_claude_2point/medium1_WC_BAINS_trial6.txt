Thank you for providing the floor plan and the navigation task. I'll first list out the rooms and their door connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan to get from the WC to the BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
1. WC: Connected to DEGT via D8
2. DEGT: Connected to WC via D8, CH.2 via D6, CH.1 via D5, SEJOUR via D4
3. BAINS: Connected to DEGT via D7
4. SEJOUR: Connected to DEGT via D4, CUISINE via D3
5. CUISINE: Connected to SEJOUR via D3
6. CH.1: Connected to DEGT via D5
7. CH.2: Connected to DEGT via D6
8. CELLIER: Connected to CUISINE via D2
9. Porche: Connected to SEJOUR via D1

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in WC
2. ApproachDoor(D8)
3. OpenDoor(D8)
4. GoThrough(D8) - Now in DEGT
5. ApproachDoor(D7)
6. OpenDoor(D7)
7. GoThrough(D7) - Now in BAINS (destination reached)

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "WC",
  "end": "BAINS",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from the WC to the BAINS, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
