Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
- D1: Connects Cellier and Hall
- D2: Connects Bains and Hall
- D3: Connects WC and Hall
- D4: Connects Hall and Chambre 1
- D5: Connects Hall and Chambre 2
- D6: Connects Hall and Porche
- D7: Connects Hall and Cuisine
- D8: Connects Cuisine and Terrasse Couverte
- D9: Connects Cellier and Garage

Step-by-step navigation plan from Cuisine to Chambre 1:
1. Start in Cuisine
2. Approach and open D7 to enter Hall
3. From Hall, approach and open D4 to enter Chambre 1

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from Cuisine to Chambre 1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
