Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from CH.1 to CH.2.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

1. CH.1 connects to SEJOUR through D4
2. CH.2 connects to SEJOUR through D3
3. CH.3 connects to SEJOUR through D1 and D2
4. CUISINE connects to SEJOUR through D5 and D6

Navigation Plan:

To move from CH.1 to CH.2, we need to go through the SEJOUR area. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. ApproachDoor(D4)
2. OpenDoor(D4)
3. GoThrough(D4)
4. ApproachDoor(D3)
5. OpenDoor(D3)
6. GoThrough(D3)

This plan takes you from CH.1 to SEJOUR, and then from SEJOUR to CH.2, using the most direct route available.

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"}
  ]
}
```

This path ensures that you navigate efficiently from CH.1 to CH.2 using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
