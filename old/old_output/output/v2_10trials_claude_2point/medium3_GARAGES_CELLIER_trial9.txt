Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and their door connections, then provide a step-by-step navigation plan from the GARAGES to the CELLIER.

Room and Door Connections:
1. GARAGES - connected to HALL via D1
2. HALL - connected to GARAGES via D1, WC via D4, DOUCHE via D2, CHAMBRE 1 via D5, CUISINE via D6
3. WC - connected to HALL via D4
4. DOUCHE - connected to HALL via D2
5. CHAMBRE 1 - connected to HALL via D5
6. CUISINE - connected to HALL via D6, CELLIER via D3
7. CELLIER - connected to CUISINE via D3

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in GARAGES
2. ApproachDoor(D1)
3. OpenDoor(D1)
4. GoThrough(D1) to enter HALL
5. ApproachDoor(D6)
6. OpenDoor(D6)
7. GoThrough(D6) to enter CUISINE
8. ApproachDoor(D3)
9. OpenDoor(D3)
10. GoThrough(D3) to reach CELLIER

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "GARAGES",
  "end": "CELLIER",
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D1"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the GARAGES to the CELLIER, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
