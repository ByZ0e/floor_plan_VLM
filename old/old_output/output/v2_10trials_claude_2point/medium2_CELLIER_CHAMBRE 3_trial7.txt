Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the CELLIER to CHAMBRE 3.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects GARAGE and HALL
2. D2: Connects CHAMBRE 1 and HALL
3. D3: Connects HALL and WC
4. D4: Connects HALL and BAINS
5. D5: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 3
6. D6: Connects HALL and CHAMBRE 2
7. D7: Connects CELLIER and HALL
8. D8: Connects HALL and Porche

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in CELLIER
2. ApproachDoor(D7)
3. OpenDoor(D7)
4. GoThrough(D7) to enter HALL
5. ApproachDoor(D5)
6. OpenDoor(D5)
7. GoThrough(D5) to enter CHAMBRE 3

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CELLIER",
  "end": "CHAMBRE 3",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the CELLIER to CHAMBRE 3, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
