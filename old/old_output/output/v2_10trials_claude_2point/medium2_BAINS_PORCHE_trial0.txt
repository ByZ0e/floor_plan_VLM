Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan from BAINS to PORCHE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects GARAGE and HALL
2. D2: Connects CHAMBRE1 and HALL
3. D3: Connects WC and HALL
4. D4: Connects BAINS and HALL
5. D5: Connects CHAMBRE3 and HALL
6. D6: Connects CHAMBRE2 and HALL
7. D7: Connects CELLIER and HALL
8. D8: Connects HALL and PORCHE

Navigation Plan:
To go from BAINS to PORCHE, we need to:
1. Exit BAINS to HALL
2. Move through HALL
3. Exit HALL to PORCHE

Here's the detailed action plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 4
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": 8
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": 8
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": 8
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most direct and efficient route from BAINS to PORCHE using only the necessary doors.
