Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from CH.2 to SEJOUR.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects CH.3 and SEJOUR
2. D2 connects CH.2 and CH.3
3. D3 connects CH.2 and SEJOUR
4. D4 connects CH.1 and SEJOUR
5. D5 connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
6. D6 connects SEJOUR and CUISINE

Now, for the navigation plan from CH.2 to SEJOUR:

The most direct path from CH.2 to SEJOUR is through door D3.

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CH.2
2. Approach door D3
3. Open door D3
4. Go through door D3 to enter SEJOUR

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "CH.2",
  "end": "SEJOUR",
  "plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D3"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D3"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from CH.2 to SEJOUR using only the necessary door (D3) without passing through any unnecessary rooms or doors.
