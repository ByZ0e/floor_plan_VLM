Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the WC to the BAINS.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D8 connects WC to DEGT
2. D7 connects DEGT to BAINS
3. D6 connects DEGT to CH.2
4. D5 connects CH.1 to DEGT
5. D4 connects SEJOUR to DEGT
6. D3 connects CUISINE to SEJOUR
7. D2 connects CUISINE to CELLIER
8. D1 connects SEJOUR to Porche

Step-by-step Navigation Plan:
1. Start in WC
2. ApproachDoor(8)
3. OpenDoor(8)
4. GoThrough(8) to enter DEGT
5. ApproachDoor(7)
6. OpenDoor(7)
7. GoThrough(7) to reach BAINS

JSON Format Navigation Plan:
```json
{
  "start": "WC",
  "end": "BAINS",
  "steps": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan provides the most direct and efficient route from the WC to the BAINS, using only the necessary doors (D8 and D7) to reach the destination.
