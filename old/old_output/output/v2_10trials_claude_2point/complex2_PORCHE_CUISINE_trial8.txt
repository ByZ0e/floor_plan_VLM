Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from the PORCHE to the CUISINE.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1: Connects CELLIER to HALL
2. D2: Connects CHAMBRE 2 to HALL
3. D3: Connects BAINS to HALL
4. D4: Connects WC to HALL
5. D5: Connects PORCHE to HALL
6. D6: Connects CHAMBRE 1 to HALL
7. D7: Connects CUISINE to HALL
8. D8: Connects CUISINE to TERRASSE COUVERTE
9. D9: Connects GARAGE to CELLIER

Step-by-step navigation plan:
1. Start in PORCHE
2. ApproachDoor(D5)
3. OpenDoor(D5)
4. GoThrough(D5) to enter HALL
5. ApproachDoor(D7)
6. OpenDoor(D7)
7. GoThrough(D7) to enter CUISINE

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "start": "PORCHE",
  "end": "CUISINE",
  "actions": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from the PORCHE to the CUISINE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or actions.
