Certainly! I'll provide you with a detailed navigation plan based on the floor plan image you've shared. Let's start by listing the rooms and doors with their connections, then create the navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
1. CHAMBRE 1 - D6 - HALL
2. HALL - D4 - WC
3. HALL - D3 - BAINS
4. HALL - D2 - CHAMBRE 2
5. CHAMBRE 2 - D5 - PORCHE
6. PORCHE - D5 - HALL
7. HALL - D7 - CUISINE
8. CUISINE - D8 - TERRASSE COUVERTE
9. GARAGE - D9 - CELLIER
10. CELLIER - D1 - HALL

Now, let's create the navigation plan to go from CHAMBRE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE:

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CHAMBRE 1
2. Use D6 to enter the HALL
3. Navigate through the HALL to reach D7
4. Use D7 to enter the CUISINE
5. Use D8 to reach the TERRASSE COUVERTE

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D6"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D7"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D8"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D8"}
  ]
}
```

This navigation plan provides the most efficient path from CHAMBRE 1 to TERRASSE COUVERTE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours. The plan takes into account that doors close after each GoThrough action, so each door is approached, opened, and gone through in sequence.
