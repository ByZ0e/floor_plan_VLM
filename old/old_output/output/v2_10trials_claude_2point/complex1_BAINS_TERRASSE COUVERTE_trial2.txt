Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the rooms, doors, and their connections, then provide a navigation plan from the BAINS to the TERRASSE COUVERTE.

Room and Door Connections:

D1: Connects CELLIER and HALL
D2: Connects BAINS and HALL
D3: Connects WC and HALL
D4: Connects CHAMBRE 1 and HALL
D5: Connects CHAMBRE 2 and HALL
D6: Connects HALL and PORCHE
D7: Connects HALL and CUISINE
D8: Connects CUISINE and TERRASSE COUVERTE
D9: Connects CELLIER and GARAGE

Step-by-step navigation plan:

1. Start in BAINS
2. Use D2 to enter HALL
3. Move through HALL
4. Use D7 to enter CUISINE
5. Move through CUISINE
6. Use D8 to reach TERRASSE COUVERTE

Now, I'll provide the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 7},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 7},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 8},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 8}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from the BAINS to the TERRASSE COUVERTE, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
