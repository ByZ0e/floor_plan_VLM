Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll analyze the layout, list the rooms and doors with their connections, and then provide a navigation plan from CH.3 to CH.1.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

Rooms:
- CH.3
- CH.2
- CH.1
- SEJOUR (multiple instances)
- CUISINE

Doors and their connections:
D1: Connects CH.3 to SEJOUR
D2: Connects CH.2 to SEJOUR
D3: Connects CH.2 to SEJOUR
D4: Connects CH.1 to SEJOUR
D5: Connects CUISINE to SEJOUR
D6: Connects CUISINE to SEJOUR

Navigation Plan:
To go from CH.3 to CH.1, we need to use the following doors: D1 and D4.

Step-by-step solution:
1. Start in CH.3
2. Use D1 to enter SEJOUR
3. Cross SEJOUR
4. Use D4 to enter CH.1

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 1},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 1},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 4},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 4}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from CH.3 to CH.1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
