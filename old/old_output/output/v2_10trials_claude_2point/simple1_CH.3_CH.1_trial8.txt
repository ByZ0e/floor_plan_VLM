Thank you for providing the floor plan. Let me first describe the rooms and doors with their connections, and then I'll provide the navigation plan.

Room and Door Connections:
- CH.3 is connected to SEJOUR through D1
- CH.2 is connected to SEJOUR through D2
- CH.2 is connected to SEJOUR through D3
- CH.1 is connected to SEJOUR through D4
- CUISINE is connected to SEJOUR through D5
- CUISINE is connected to SEJOUR through D6

Now, for the navigation plan from CH.3 to CH.1:

Step 1: Exit CH.3 to enter SEJOUR
Step 2: Move through SEJOUR
Step 3: Enter CH.1 from SEJOUR

Here's the detailed action plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigationPlan": [
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D1"
    },
    {
      "action": "ApproachDoor",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "OpenDoor",
      "door": "D4"
    },
    {
      "action": "GoThrough",
      "door": "D4"
    }
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient route from CH.3 to CH.1, using only the necessary doors (D1 and D4) and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
