Thank you for providing the floor plan image. I'll analyze the layout, list the room and door connections, and then provide a navigation plan from the CUISINE to CH.1.

Explicit Room and Door Descriptions:

D1: Connects BAINS to HALL
D2: Connects CH.1 to HALL
D3: Connects CH.2 to HALL
D4: Connects GARAGE to CUISINE
D5: Connects CUISINE to HALL

Step-by-step navigation plan:

1. Start in CUISINE
2. Approach and go through D5 to enter HALL
3. Move through HALL
4. Approach and go through D2 to enter CH.1

Here's the final navigation plan in JSON format:

```json
{
  "navigation_plan": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 5},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 5},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": 2},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": 2}
  ]
}
```

This plan provides the most efficient path from the CUISINE to CH.1, using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or detours.
