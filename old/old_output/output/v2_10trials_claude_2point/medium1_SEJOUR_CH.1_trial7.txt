Thank you for providing the floor plan. I'll first list out the rooms and doors with their connections, then provide a navigation plan to get from SEJOUR to CH.1.

Room and Door Connections:
1. D1 connects SEJOUR and Porche
2. D2 connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
3. D3 connects SEJOUR and CUISINE
4. D4 connects SEJOUR and DEGT
5. D5 connects CH.1 and DEGT
6. D6 connects CH.2 and DEGT
7. D7 connects BAINS and DEGT
8. D8 connects WC and DEGT

Now, for the navigation plan from SEJOUR to CH.1:

1. ApproachDoor(D4)
2. OpenDoor(D4)
3. GoThrough(D4)
4. ApproachDoor(D5)
5. OpenDoor(D5)
6. GoThrough(D5)

Here's the final path in JSON format:

```json
{
  "path": [
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D4"},
    {"action": "ApproachDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "OpenDoor", "door": "D5"},
    {"action": "GoThrough", "door": "D5"}
  ]
}
```

This plan will efficiently navigate you from the SEJOUR to CH.1 using only the necessary doors and avoiding any unnecessary rooms or doors.
